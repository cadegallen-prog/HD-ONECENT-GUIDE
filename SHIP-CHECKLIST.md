# Ship Checklist - Penny Central

Quick wins to take the site from "draft" to "shipped."

## Week 1 - Must Have (Credibility)
- [ ] Remove all PLACEHOLDER text from guide
- [ ] Fix Recent Finds page honesty (remove "live feed" lie)
- [ ] Make TOC sections visible by default
- [ ] Add Facebook link to hero

## Week 1 - Nice to Have (Polish)
- [ ] Improve hero visual (replace placeholder box)
- [ ] Add aria-labels for accessibility
- [ ] Clean up FAQ duplicated text

## Week 2 - Optional (Future)
- [ ] Consider adding 2-3 real community find examples
- [ ] Add Open Graph meta tags for social sharing
- [ ] Consider adding a "New to penny hunting? Start here" callout

## Out of Scope (Do Not Build)
- Real-time finds submission system
- User accounts or authentication
- Prediction algorithms
- Additional tools beyond Store Finder / Trip Tracker
