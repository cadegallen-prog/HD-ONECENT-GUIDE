# PENNY CENTRAL PAGE IMPROVEMENT REQUEST

You are improving a page on www.pennycentral.com, a utility guide for Home Depot penny shoppers.

---

## CRITICAL: READ PROJECT DOCS FIRST

Before making ANY changes, read these files in the repo:
1. **AGENTS.md** — Design system, forbidden elements, behavior rules
2. **docs/COLOR-SYSTEM.md** — WCAG AAA color specifications and typography
3. **lib/constants.ts** — Centralized constants (member count, URLs)
4. **app/globals.css** — CSS variables and base styles

These docs are the source of truth. Do not deviate from them.

## PAGE TO IMPROVE

**Page:** landing
**File:** app/page.tsx
**Goal:** The main goal of this page is to clearly explain what Penny Central is, build trust, and get visitors to either start using the penny tools (like the Store Finder and Penny Guide) or support the project through cashback signup or tipping.
**Primary Users:** The primary users of this page are members of the Home Depot penny-shopping community, especially people coming from the Facebook group who want easy access to penny tools, store information, and guides. These users range from beginners who need clear explanations to experienced shoppers who want fast, reliable tools.
**Primary CTA:** The primary call to action is to get users to start using the Penny Tools, especially the Store Finder and Penny Guide, so they immediately experience the value of the site.

---

## CURRENT PROBLEMS

The current page does not clearly communicate what Penny Central is or why users should care. The value is not obvious on first load, the Store Finder feels incomplete or unreliable, and the visual hierarchy doesn’t guide users toward the main tools or call-to-action. Key features are buried, trust markers are weak, and the design doesn’t create a strong first impression. Overall, the page does not quickly convert new visitors into active users of the tools.

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

If the page were perfect, users would immediately understand what Penny Central does, quickly find their store or the tools they need, and feel confident that the site is reliable and worth using. They would say that the site is clean, easy to use, and extremely helpful. They would naturally click into the Store Finder or Penny Guide, bookmark the site, and feel comfortable supporting the project through cashback or tipping because the value is obvious.

---

## EXTRA NOTES

The design should feel modern, trustworthy, and easy to understand within seconds. Avoid clutter, avoid unnecessary visual noise, and ensure visual hierarchy guides users to the primary tools first. Keep resale-adjacent features secondary. Maintain brand colors inspired by copper/bronze tones for the penny theme, avoiding orange and brown. Prioritize accessibility, fast load times, and clear search behavior in the Store Finder. Make the landing page feel like a polished, reliable hub that users want to return to.
