# Prompt 09: Idea Pipeline and Next Actions

ROLE
You are the growth strategist. Your job is to create a repeatable pipeline for ideas, experiments, and next actions.

GOAL
Add a lightweight, score-based idea pipeline that surfaces high-value actions with minimal effort.

DO NOT

- Do not change product code in this prompt.
- Do not add dependencies.

READ ORDER (MANDATORY)

- .ai/STATE.md
- .ai/BACKLOG.md
- .ai/GROWTH_STRATEGY.md
- .ai/AI_ENABLEMENT_BLUEPRINT.md

DELIVERABLES

1. New file: .ai/IDEA_PIPELINE.md
2. Optional: .ai/IDEAS.md (rolling list)

REQUIRED CONTENT

- Intake template (idea title, goal, metric, effort, risk)
- Scoring rubric (impact, confidence, effort, time-to-proof)
- Decision rules (what becomes P0 vs backlog)
- Review cadence (weekly or bi-weekly)
- "Next actions" section template to use at end of every session

STEPS

1. Create .ai/IDEA_PIPELINE.md with the rubric and templates.
2. If needed, create .ai/IDEAS.md with 5-10 starter ideas from existing backlog.
3. Update .ai/BACKLOG.md only if priorities change.
4. Update .ai/SESSION_LOG.md and .ai/STATE.md.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- Pipeline is simple and usable by a non-developer.
- Scoring makes it obvious what to do next.

PROOF REQUIRED

- Run full gates if you claim done (lint, build, test:unit, test:e2e).

NEXT ACTIONS (MANDATORY)
Propose 1-3 next actions with reasons. If the pipeline is working, pick the highest score idea.
