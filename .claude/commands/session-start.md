## 1. Read Required Docs

1. `.ai/VERIFICATION_REQUIRED.md` - Quality gates

3. `.ai/GROWTH_STRATEGY.md` - Business goals
4. `.ai/STATE.md` - Current snapshot
5. `.ai/BACKLOG.md` - Prioritized work
6. Latest entry in `.ai/SESSION_LOG.md`

## 2. Run Health Check

Execute: `npm run ai:doctor`

Fix any issues before proceeding.

## 3. Capture Goal

Get from user:
- **GOAL:** What will be accomplished
- **WHY:** Business value
- **DONE:** Success criteria

Push back if request is unclear or problematic.

## 4. Check Session Log Size

If `.ai/SESSION_LOG.md` > 5 entries, trim to 3 (Rule #5).

## 5. Confirm Ready

"I've read the docs and run health check. Ready to begin."
