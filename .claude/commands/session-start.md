description: Start a new coding session with proper context

**Remember:** Cade cannot code. You are fully responsible for all technical decisions and verification.

## 1. Read Required Docs

Start with `VISION_CHARTER.md`, then follow `.ai/START_HERE.md` Tier 1 (mandatory every session):

1. `VISION_CHARTER.md` - Highest authority
2. `.ai/START_HERE.md` - Entry point + alignment gate
3. `.ai/CRITICAL_RULES.md` - Never violate
4. `.ai/STATE.md` - Current snapshot
5. `.ai/BACKLOG.md` - Prioritized work

Also skim: latest entry in `.ai/SESSION_LOG.md`

## 2. Run Health Check

Execute: `npm run ai:doctor`

Fix any issues before proceeding.

## 3. Capture Goal

Get from user:

- **GOAL:** What will be accomplished
- **WHY:** Business value
- **DONE MEANS:** Success criteria
- **NOT DOING:** Explicit exclusions
- **CONSTRAINTS:** Hard boundaries
- **ASSUMPTIONS:** Temporary assumptions to validate
- **CHALLENGES:** Known risks or blockers

Push back if request is unclear or problematic.

## 4. Check Session Log Size

If `.ai/SESSION_LOG.md` has more than 7 entries, trim to keep the 5 most recent (Rule #5).

## 5. Confirm Ready

"I've read the docs and run health check. Ready to begin."
