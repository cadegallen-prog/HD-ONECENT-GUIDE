    <h1>Digital Pre-Hunt: Using the Home Depot App &amp; Website</h1>

    <p>Before heading into a store, use Home Depot's app or website to scout items that might have reached penny status.</p>

    <p><strong>Important:</strong> The app won't show you the $0.01 price directly—but it <strong>can</strong> give you signals that an item has been marked internally.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Step 1: Set Your Store Location</h2>

    <p>In the app or online, <strong>set your specific store location</strong> before searching.</p>

    <p>Why this matters:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Inventory and pricing data is <strong>store-specific</strong></li>
      <li>Wrong location = wrong info</li>
      <li>An item might be pennied at Store A but still full price at Store B</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>How to set it:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open the Home Depot app or website</li>
      <li>Tap the location icon or "My Store" dropdown</li>
      <li>Select the exact store you plan to visit</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>Step 2: Search by SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)</h2>

    <p>Find the <strong>SKU number</strong> on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Product packaging</li>
      <li>Yellow clearance tag</li>
      <li>Community posts (if someone shared a known penny item)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Use that number in the Home Depot app or site search bar.</p>

    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Searching by SKU is more accurate than searching by product name, which can pull up similar but unrelated items.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Step 3: Interpret What You See</h2>

    <p>Once you've searched an item, use the chart below to decode what the listing might mean:</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Online Status</th>
          <th>What It Could Mean</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>In Stock + Clearance Price visible</strong></td>
          <td>Still in clearance cycle, not pennied yet</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>In Stock + Full Price</strong></td>
          <td>Still active inventory</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Out of Stock / Unavailable / Ship to Store Only + Full Price</strong></td>
          <td><strong>Strong penny candidate</strong> — system may have pennied it, but it hasn't been removed from shelves yet</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Clearance price still showing online</strong></td>
          <td>Not yet a penny item</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> If the system shows a <strong>full price</strong> but <strong>no stock</strong>, it might have already hit $0.01 internally and just hasn't been pulled.</p>

    <h2>Limitations to Keep in Mind</h2>

    <p>Digital scouting is helpful, but it's not foolproof.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Online data isn't real-time</strong> — there can be a delay of 1–2 days</li>
      <li><strong>The penny price ($0.01) never shows online</strong></li>
      <li><strong>You still need in-store confirmation to be sure</strong> — this is just a filtering step</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Don't make a special trip based solely on app data. Use it to narrow down which stores and items are worth checking in person.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>When to Go In-Store</h2>

    <p>Only go check in person if:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You've found an item that shows <strong>no local stock</strong> but is still listed online</li>
      <li>You're tracking the item based on its <strong>clearance cycle and tag date</strong></li>
      <li>You've seen reports in <strong>penny shopping communities</strong> about that item pennying out recently</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If the item shows in stock at full clearance price, it's probably not pennied yet. Wait and check again in a week or two.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Advanced Tip: Track Multiple Stores</h2>

    <p>If you live near multiple Home Depot locations, check the app for the same SKU across all of them.</p>

    <p>Why? Because:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One store might penny an item while another still has it at full price</li>
      <li>Store-specific returns or overstock can trigger penny status at one location only</li>
      <li>Seasonal changeovers happen at different speeds per store</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Switch your "My Store" location in the app and search again. Compare inventory status across stores to find the best candidate.</p>

    <p><strong>Next:</strong> Once you've scouted online and identified potential penny items, it's time to head in-store. Learn the best tactics in <a href="in-store-strategy.html">In-Store Strategy</a>.</p>
