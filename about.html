    <h1>About This Guide</h1>

    <p>This guide is a comprehensive resource on finding and buying Home Depot penny items—written for savvy shoppers who want to understand the real process behind the phenomenon.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>What This Guide Is</h2>

    <p>This is a <strong>community-driven resource</strong> based on:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Consistent observations</strong> from penny shoppers across the country</li>
      <li><strong>Shared receipts, screenshots, and experiences</strong> from online communities</li>
      <li><strong>Retail logic</strong> and how clearance cycles typically work in big-box stores</li>
      <li><strong>Trial and error</strong> from real people hunting penny items over time</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It's not insider information. It's not leaked corporate documents. It's pattern recognition and shared knowledge.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>What This Guide Is NOT</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Not official Home Depot policy</strong> — Nothing here is endorsed or confirmed by Home Depot</li>
      <li><strong>Not guaranteed to work</strong> — Every store, manager, and situation is different</li>
      <li><strong>Not legal advice</strong> — We're not lawyers. Know your local consumer protection laws.</li>
      <li><strong>Not a get-rich-quick scheme</strong> — Penny hunting takes time, patience, and a lot of dry runs</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>Why This Guide Exists</h2>

    <p>Penny hunting has become a popular hobby for deal seekers, resellers, and DIY enthusiasts. But a lot of the information out there is scattered, outdated, or buried in Facebook groups and Reddit threads.</p>

    <p>This guide pulls it all together in one place—organized, practical, and honest.</p>

    <p>Our goal is to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Help you understand <strong>how</strong> and <strong>why</strong> penny items exist</li>
      <li>Teach you <strong>strategies that actually work</strong></li>
      <li>Separate <strong>facts from myths</strong></li>
      <li>Encourage <strong>responsible hunting</strong> so the practice doesn't get ruined for everyone</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>Important Disclaimers</h2>

    <h3>Use This Information at Your Own Risk</h3>

    <p>Penny hunting exists in a gray area. Home Depot doesn't publicly acknowledge the practice, and store policies vary widely.</p>

    <p>By using the tactics in this guide, you accept the following risks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Denial of sale</strong> — Stores can refuse to sell penny items</li>
      <li><strong>Item confiscation</strong> — Managers may demand items back, even after purchase</li>
      <li><strong>Store bans</strong> — Repeat issues can result in being trespassed from the property</li>
      <li><strong>Wasted time</strong> — You may spend hours hunting and find nothing</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>We are not responsible for any consequences you face while penny hunting.</strong></p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Respect Store Employees</h3>

    <p>Employees are doing their jobs. They didn't create the penny item system, and they're often just following orders.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Don't harass staff</li>
      <li>Don't cause scenes</li>
      <li>Don't argue aggressively</li>
      <li>Stay polite, even if denied</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

    <p>Penny hunting is part <strong>skill</strong>, part <strong>patience</strong>, and part <strong>luck</strong>.</p>

    <p>It's not for everyone. It requires time, persistence, and a willingness to accept that most trips will be busts.</p>

    <p>But for those who enjoy the hunt—the strategy, the thrill, the occasional win—it can be rewarding.</p>

    <p><strong>Stay smart. Stay respectful. Play the long game.</strong></p>
