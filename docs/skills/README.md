# Skills Index

Short, task-focused guides to avoid repo-wide searching.

**How to use this (for you, Cade):**

- When you start a new request, tell the agent: **"Read `docs/skills/README.md` first and follow the relevant skill."**
- If the skill doesn’t exist yet, ask the agent to **add a short new skill after finishing the task** so future sessions get faster.

## Skills

- [repo-map](./repo-map.md) — **When to use:** You’re unsure where things live (pages, data, scripts, tests).
- [feature-to-files](./feature-to-files.md) — **When to use:** You know the feature but not the exact starting files.
- [local-dev-faststart](./local-dev-faststart.md) — **When to use:** You need to run the site locally or debug a dev server issue.
- [ship-safely](./ship-safely.md) — **When to use:** You’re getting ready to commit, verify, or roll back safely.
- [codex-mcp-setup](./codex-mcp-setup.md) — **When to use:** Codex can’t see MCP tools/resources or env vars, or you need to update Codex.
