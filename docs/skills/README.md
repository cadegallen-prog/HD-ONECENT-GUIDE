# Skills Index

Short, task-focused guides to avoid repo-wide searching.

**How to use this (for you, Cade):**

- When you start a new request, tell the agent: **"Read `docs/skills/README.md` first and follow the relevant skill."**
- If the skill doesn’t exist yet, ask the agent to **add a short new skill after finishing the task** so future sessions get faster.
