# Skills Index

Use this folder as the **first stop** before repo-wide searching. Each skill is a small, practical guide for a recurring task.

## How to use this (for you, Cade)

When you ask an AI to make a change, tell them to read `/docs/skills/README.md` first. These guides shorten the back-and-forth and help the AI find the right files quickly.

## Skills

| Skill | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| [repo-map](./repo-map.md) | When you need the authoritative map of where things live. |
| [feature-to-files](./feature-to-files.md) | When you know the feature but not the starting files. |
| [local-dev-faststart](./local-dev-faststart.md) | When you need to run the app locally or check env/ports. |
