# Archived Workflows

These workflows are kept for reference but are **not active** (they are not under `.github/workflows`).

Why this exists:

- Sometimes GitHub-hosted runners get blocked upstream (e.g., Cloudflare / bot protection), making scheduled jobs unreliable.
- Keeping the original YAML makes it easy to re-enable later (e.g., via self-hosted runner) without reconstructing history.
