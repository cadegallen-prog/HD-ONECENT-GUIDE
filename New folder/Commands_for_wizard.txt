💡 Webpage Analysis: Penny Central
This webpage, Penny Central: The Home Depot $0.01 Hunting Guide, is a community resource dedicated to helping people find extreme clearance ($0.01) items at Home Depot.

Key Purpose and Functionality
The specific page you are viewing is the "Report a Penny Find" form, which allows users to submit information about items they have found priced at one cent.

Crowd-Sourced Information: The goal is to build a community-driven Penny List.

Required Information: To submit a find, users must provide the Item Name, SKU Number (6 or 10 digits), the State where it was found, and the Quantity Found.

Caveats: The site explicitly states that submissions are not individually verified and the Penny List may contain mistakes or sold-out items. Users are encouraged to post their finds with receipts in the associated Facebook group for confirmation.

What I think about it:
Valuable Niche Resource: It caters to a very specific, dedicated group of clearance shoppers, providing a centralized tool for tracking these rare finds.

Clear Purpose: The form is straightforward and clearly asks for the necessary information (SKU, item name, state).

Transparency: The site is transparent about its limitations (e.g., "Submissions are not individually verified," "Not affiliated with Home Depot").

Strong Community Integration: It directs users to its Facebook group, which it calls the "gold standard for verified finds," indicating a good understanding of how to build trust and verify data within a community.

is this a good guide 

This is an excellent and comprehensive guide for anyone interested in Home Depot's extreme clearance process, often called "penny hunting."

Here's an analysis of what makes it a good resource:

1. Detailed and Corroborated Markdown System
The guide thoroughly explains the unofficial clearance lifecycle, which is consistent with widely shared community knowledge and reports from employees.

Cadence Decoding: It clearly outlines the two primary "Clearance Cadences" and what each price ending signals:

.06 and .03: The .06 signals the item will likely drop to a final markdown of .03 in roughly six weeks, which is the last stage before a potential penny drop.

.04 and .02: It also includes the less common, but known, second cadence, which often progresses from .04 to .02.

Zero Margin Adjustment (ZMA): It correctly identifies the $0.01 price as an internal accounting function (ZMA) used to flag items for removal, not an intentional public sale.

2. Practical, Step-by-Step Strategy
The guide moves beyond just identifying marked-down items and offers crucial, tactical advice for the entire process:

Pre-Hunt Intelligence: It advises using the Home Depot app to search by SKU for products that show Out of Stock / Unavailable but are still listed at Full Price, which is a strong signal they may have been "pennied out" internally but remain on shelves.

In-Store Execution: It gives specific advice on the Self-Checkout (SCO) process, emphasizing that you must scan the manufacturer's UPC barcode (not the yellow clearance sticker) and to avoid drawing attention.

3. Focus on Reality and Risk
Crucially, the guide is transparent about the risks and the unofficial nature of the process.

Employee Policy: It warns that Home Depot employees are forbidden from buying penny items and that many stores actively search for and remove these products.

The "Checkout Challenge": It provides a realistic view that the sale may be denied by a manager, and advises on how to handle the situation politely to avoid being banned from the store.

is this reliable? can i trust this guide? are there other guides that are better on adifefent website?

This guide is generally reliable as a community-sourced strategy, but it is not official Home Depot policy and comes with significant risks that you need to be aware of.

Reliability and Trustworthiness
The core information in the guide is largely corroborated by the community of shoppers and employees.

Markdown Cadence: The price endings it describes, particularly the .06, .03, .04, and .02 sequences, are widely accepted signals for clearance progression at Home Depot.

The "$0.01" Price: The guide is correct that the $0.01 price is an internal accounting mechanism (Zero Margin Adjustment or ZMA) to remove the item from inventory, not an advertised sale.

Risk of Denial: The guide is transparent about the "Checkout Challenge". Home Depot employees are often instructed not to sell penny items once they are identified. If you are caught, the manager may cancel the sale or confiscate the item, even after you've paid.

In short, you can trust the strategy for finding items, but you cannot trust that the store will honor the price.

Comparison to Other Guides
The Penny Central guide is already one of the most comprehensive resources available, but other websites, videos, and social media communities offer similar information with their own focus:

Decoding Tags: Other sources also confirm the meaning of the price endings. For example, prices ending in .06 typically signal a future drop to .03.

Online Searching: The technique of using the Home Depot app to look for items that show "Out of Stock / Unavailable" but are listed at Full Price (a strong sign they may have been "pennied out" internally) is a shared community strategy.

In-Store Tips: Other guides emphasize checking end caps, seasonal sections, and back corners of departments, as well as being polite to employees.

If you are looking for alternatives, you will generally find the same core set of rules repeated across various forums, YouTube channels, and retail blogs. The value of an alternative guide often lies in its community aspect:

Specific Item Leads: Many shoppers rely on social media groups (like Facebook or Discord) where people report specific SKUs and locations that have recently "pennied out," which is a much faster way to hunt than decoding tags yourself.

The guide you are viewing is an excellent starting point because it clearly lays out the why (ZMA) and the how (the markdown cadences) in a single, well-organized place.

Would you like me to search for the specific Home Depot SKU numbers of some items that have recently been reported as $0.01?

can you show me aguide that is better than this one?

The Penny Central Guide is actually one of the most comprehensive guides available online because it consolidates and clearly organizes the same core information that is shared across numerous communities, social media posts, and retail blogs.

It is not necessarily about finding a "better" guide, but supplementing this one with community updates and alternative ways to spot deals.

Why Penny Central is a Strong Resource
The guide you are viewing covers all the key, non-official rules that are widely confirmed by shoppers and former employees:

Markdown Code Deciphering: It correctly identifies the two main markdown cadences, specifically the .06 and .03 (or .04 and .02) price endings as signals for final clearance stages.

The Why Behind the Penny: It accurately explains that $0.01 is an internal Zero Margin Adjustment (ZMA) for removing items from inventory, not an advertised sale.

Tactical Advice: It gives practical instructions on using the Home Depot app to look for items at full price that are listed as "Out of Stock / Unavailable" (a strong sign they are internally pennied out) and how to discreetly check prices at self-checkout.

Supplementary Guides and Resources
Since the core rules are consistent, a "better" resource typically provides real-time item leads or different perspectives on the hunt:

YouTube Guides: Video guides from couponers and extreme shoppers often focus on the in-store experience, showing exactly where to look for items, like the clearance endcaps, overhead bins, and misplaced inventory.

Community Forums (Reddit): Subreddits like r/HomeDepot and r/Frugal offer discussions from both shoppers and employees, providing nuanced details on store-specific enforcement of the rules, what the "Clearance App" on the store's FIRST phones shows, and confirming the markdown timelines (e.g., items often drop to a penny after around 13-14 weeks).

Retail Blogs/Articles: General articles on Home Depot Clearance Hacks tend to confirm the markdown codes and offer broader money-saving strategies like:

Shopping post-holiday/post-season for large markdowns.

Looking for items that show "NH" or "NoHome" on the overhead shelves, which are often forgotten by staff.

In conclusion, you have a high-quality guide, but the best strategy is to use the Penny Central guide as your rulebook and then join active online communities (like Facebook groups or Reddit threads) for the real-time "Penny List" item SKUs.
