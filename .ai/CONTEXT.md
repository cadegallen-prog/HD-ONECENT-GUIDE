# Project Context — Penny Central

**Last updated:** Dec 12, 2025

This file is the stable “why/what/who” for PennyCentral.com. It should change rarely. If you need current status or next tasks, see `.ai/STATE.md` and `.ai/BACKLOG.md`.

---

## Mission

PennyCentral.com is the companion utility site for the **“Home Depot One Cent Items”** Facebook community (~40,000 members).  
The mission is simple: **turn scattered penny‑hunting knowledge into a fast, reliable field guide + living intel feed.**

---

## Who We Serve

- **Primary users:** existing Facebook group members who already hunt pennies.
- **Secondary users:** organic searchers learning how pennies work.

The group is conversation and proof; the site is structured memory and tooling.

---

## Core Value Proposition

1. **Guide-first education**
   - Explains markdown lifecycle, clearance cadence, and in‑store strategy.
   - Goal: help users avoid wasted trips and confusion.

2. **Practical tools**
   - Store Finder for planning hunts.
   - Trip Tracker is optional/future and must stay low‑maintenance.

3. **Crowd Reports → Penny List**
   - Users report finds in <30 seconds.
   - The site aggregates by SKU and shows:
     - recent leads (last 30 days),
     - report counts by state,
     - auto‑calculated rarity tiers.
   - Goal: give a nationwide/regional view the group cannot provide natively.

---

## What Success Looks Like (6–12 months)

- The guide and tools are stable, fast, mobile‑first (Lighthouse ≥90 mobile).
- Penny List updates itself from community input with **near‑zero daily founder work**.
- Returning users from the FB group form a weekly habit.
- Monetization foundation (BeFrugal + tips) reliably covers hosting.

**Note:** This does not need to be a massive traffic engine to be a success. A smaller core of returning hunters is the realistic target.

---

## Non‑Goals

- No marketplace, forum, or comments (community stays on Facebook).
- No gamification (badges, leaderboards, XP).
- No scraping HD inventory.
- No accounts/auth until volume makes it unavoidable.

---

## Hard Constraints (Don’t Drift)

- Founder is a non‑coder; solutions must be low‑maintenance and Sheet‑operable.
- Design system is WCAG AAA and intentionally minimal.
- Affiliate `/go/*` links must stay plain anchors (no prefetch/fetch).
- Dev→main deployment discipline is mandatory.

---

## Current Phase

**Foundation & Stabilization with light Community Intake.**  
Highest‑leverage work is always the **Report Find → Penny List retention loop**.
