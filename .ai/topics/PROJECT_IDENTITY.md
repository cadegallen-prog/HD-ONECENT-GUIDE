# Project Identity & Origin Story

**Source of Truth** for the "Founder-Led" narrative.

## The Founders & Admins

- **Spoe Jarky:** The original founder of the "Home Depot One Cent Items" community. (Real name: Joe, but we MUST refer to him as "Spoe Jarky" or "Spoe" public-facing).
- **Cade (You/The Nurse):** The builder of PennyCentral.com.
  - Nurse by trade, no coding experience.
  - Built the site essentially to "host a PDF" because Facebook files were broken on mobile.
  - Handled the technical build alongside the admin work.
- **Jorian Wulf:** Admin/Moderator who helped restart the community.

## The Timeline

- **April 5, 2025:** The "Restart". The original group was sold out by a previous owner. Spoe, Cade, and Jorian restarted it from zero.
- **Dec 4, 2025:** PennyCentral.com launches (Group size ~32,000).
- **Feb 13, 2026:** Group crosses 64,000+ members (<10 months).

## The Philosophy ("The Scavenger Hunt")

- Penny shopping is **NOT about the items** (Cade has a storage unit full of stuff he doesn't need).
- It is about **the fun, the challenge, and the scavenger hunt**.
- The website is an extension of the community—doing what Facebook can't (indexing history, searchable data).

## Key Constraints for "Trust" Content

- **"We" vs "I":**
  - Use **"We"** when referring to the Community, the Admin Team, or the Movement.
  - Use **"I"** when referring to the Website Build/Code (since Cade is the sole dev).
- **Tone:** Authentic, humble, "Nurse-turned-Dev", not corporate.
