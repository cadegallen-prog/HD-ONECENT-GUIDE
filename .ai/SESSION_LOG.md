## 2026-02-04 - Codex - Bloat reduction (archive-first pass 5: media + reports + audit)

**Goal:** Aggressively reduce repo noise (especially large media + generated report artifacts) while adding a repeatable, evidence-based prune workflow.

**Status:** ✅ Completed & verified.

### Changes

- Added an evidence-based prune inventory command:
  - `npm run prune:audit` (`scripts/prune-audit.ts`)
- Added media cold-storage:
  - `archive/media-pruned/README.md`
  - `archive/media-pruned/2026-02-04-pass1/INDEX.md`
- Archived large non-production media + legacy proof assets to `archive/media-pruned/2026-02-04-pass1/` (restore-path parity):
  - `PICTURES_PENNY_CENTRAL/**`
  - `.ai/analytics/**`
  - `reports/manual-testing/**`
  - `reports/palette-screenshots/**`
  - `reports/verification/*.png`
  - `Home Depot One Cent Items.pdf`
- Removed tracked generated report/log artifacts and prevented reintroduction:
  - Deleted tracked `reports/playwright/console-report-*.json` (generated by `tests/live/console.spec.ts`)
  - Deleted tracked `reports/axe-report.json`, `reports/contrast-computed.json`, `reports/sku-optimization-top20.json`
  - Expanded `.gitignore` to cover these paths
- Archive hygiene improvements:
  - Stopped ignoring the entire `archive/` folder in `.gitignore` (replaced with explicit ignores for local-only scratch)
  - Added missing snapshot manifests/policies:
    - `archive/docs-pruned/2026-02-03-pass2/INDEX.md`
    - `archive/scripts-pruned/2026-02-03/INDEX.md`
    - `archive/scripts-pruned/README.md`

### Verification

## 2026-02-04 - GitHub Copilot (Copilot Chat) - Guide Credibility Restoration

**Goal:** Fix content accuracy regression in clearance-lifecycle page; remove false claims, restore historical Cadence data, remove unapproved Trip Tracker CTA.

**Status:** ✅ Completed & Verified - Commit `09a0670`.

### Problem Discovery

Git audit identified that commit 1c04eb7 (Feb 3) made **unapproved content changes**:

- ❌ Removed detailed Cadence A (13-week) and Cadence B (7-week) tables from original guide
- ❌ Replaced with false "nearly 100% chance in 3 weeks" claim (credibility killer)
- ❌ Reintroduced deprecated Trip Tracker CTA without approval
- ❌ Oversized, unprofessional mobile UX (text-4xl font-black price numbers)
- ❌ No approval documentation for substantive content changes

**Impact:** Users following false "100% chance" advice will be disappointed; brand credibility damaged.

### Changes Made - `app/clearance-lifecycle/page.tsx`

1. **Restored Accurate Historical Data:**
   - Cadence A: 13-week (.00 ~4w → .06 ~6w → .03 ~3w → .01)
   - Cadence B: 7-week (.00 ~1-2w → .04 ~4w → .02 ~2w → .01)

2. **New Structure (Historical → Current Bridge):**
   - "How It Used To Work" - Historical patterns
   - "What Changed" - Why Home Depot strategy evolved
   - "Current Reality" - Honest: patterns unpredictable, info emerging
   - "Why We Show History" - Bridge narrative for credibility

3. **Removed False Content:**
   - ✅ Deleted Trip Tracker CTA (unapproved)
   - ✅ Removed "nearly 100% chance" claim
   - ✅ Removed "Success Trick" section

4. **Fixed Mobile UX:**
   - Typography: `.text-4xl` → `.text-2xl sm:text-3xl` (professional)
   - Padding: `p-8` → `p-6 sm:p-8` (responsive)

### QA Results

- ✅ Unit: All passing
