# Facts vs. Myths: Sorting Reality from Wishful Thinking

Despite how widespread penny hunting has become, Home Depot has **never publicly confirmed** the full clearance-to-penny process.

Most of what we know comes from:
- Community observations
- Shared screenshots and receipts
- Logical deductions from how retail clearance cycles work

Let's separate what's real from what's rumor.

## What the Website Says (and Doesn't Say)

### What's Confirmed:
- **Clearance and closeout items are excluded** from price matching and adjustments
  → So penny items will **never** be eligible for a price match
- The **return policy is standard** (most items returnable within 90 days with receipt)
- **Terms of Use** state Home Depot can **correct pricing errors at any time**

### What's Missing:
- **No mention of penny pricing**
- **No breakdown of the clearance process**
- **No public documentation of markdown cycles or price endings**

The official site **avoids the topic entirely**. This leaves shoppers to rely on community findings and indirect clues.

## What the Inventory System Looks Like Internally

Home Depot uses a sophisticated inventory system with:
- **Barcodes** for product tracking
- **Automation** to reorder and restock
- **ZMA (Zero Margin Adjustment)** to write off inventory

When an item hits $0.01, it's:
- Marked as **financially worthless**
- **Flagged for removal, disposal, or liquidation**
- **No longer counted toward store sales or stock**

If you see a $0.01 item, it means **the system is done with it**—it just hasn't been pulled yet.

## Clearance Patterns: Do the Cadences Hold Up?

The two clearance cadences—ending in **.06/.03** and **.04/.02**—are widely reported across:
- Reddit threads
- YouTube penny hunter videos
- Penny-shopping Facebook groups
- Reseller communities

These patterns align with:
- Typical retail markdown strategies (gradual price drops over 6–13 weeks)
- Observed timeframes (around 2–3 weeks between markdowns)
- Actual receipts showing price progressions

**While not guaranteed**, these models are accurate **often enough** to be a solid guide.

---

## How Dependable Is Community Intel?

**Very—but with a few caveats:**

- **National penny items** (brand-wide markdowns) are dependable across many stores
- **Store-specific pennies** (returns, damaged goods, unpulled clearance) are hit-or-miss
- Community screenshots and shared receipts are **gold**—but **dates matter**

**Always check timestamps** on community posts. A penny item from 4 weeks ago may already be pulled or long gone.

## Takeaway: What's Real vs. Rumor

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| **Items go to $0.01** | **True** — via internal ZMA process |
| **Price endings predict markdowns** | **True** — .06/.03 and .04/.02 are common sequences |
| **Penny items are "secret sales"** | **False** — they're not intended for sale at all |
| **Home Depot honors the first scanned price** | **Sometimes** — depends on the manager |
| **Employees buy penny items** | **False** — it's against policy and grounds for termination |
| **Using ladders to get pennies is okay** | **Yellow ladder: yes. Orange ladder: employee-only (high risk)** |
| **Stores will always sell penny items** | **False** — many will cancel the sale or remove the item |
| **Penny items show online** | **False** — the $0.01 price never appears in the app or on the website |

## Common Misconceptions

### "Penny items are a legal loophole"
**Not really.** Home Depot can refuse the sale, cancel the transaction, or demand the item back. Just because it scans at $0.01 doesn't mean you have a legal right to buy it.

### "If it scans, they have to sell it to me"
**Nope.** Stores reserve the right to correct pricing errors. Some managers honor it to avoid conflict, but many don't.

### "Employees know about penny items and are hiding them"
**Partially true.** Some employees know, but they're **forbidden from buying them**. If they get caught, they get fired. Most employees aren't scheming—they're just following orders to pull them.

### "You can return a penny item and get full price back"
**False.** Returns are processed at the purchase price. If you bought it for $0.01, you'll get $0.01 back.

### "All clearance items eventually go to $0.01"
**False.** Many clearance items get pulled, sold out, or liquidated before hitting penny status. The penny stage is the **last** stop, and many items never make it there.
