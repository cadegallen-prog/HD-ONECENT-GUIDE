# Checkout Strategy: How to Successfully Buy Penny Items

You found a penny item. Now comes the tricky part: **getting it through checkout without issues**.

---

## Preferred Method: Self-Checkout (SCO)

This is your safest bet.

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Have your payment ready** before scanning
2. Go to a self-checkout kiosk where the attendant is **distracted or busy**
3. Scan **only the UPC barcode** on the item itself—**not** the yellow clearance tag
4. Confirm it scans at **$0.01**
5. **Pay immediately**
6. **Print your receipt**—this is your proof of purchase
7. Exit calmly. Act like it's just another item in your cart

**Avoid scanning the yellow tag**—it may freeze the terminal or flag staff.

## Optional Trick: Use a "Keeper Item"

Add a small, inexpensive item you plan to buy:

- Makes your transaction look more normal
- Distracts attention from a suspicious $0.01 item
- Useful when checking out with help or when retrieving items from locked displays

Example: Grab a pack of batteries, a soda, or a cheap hook. Scan it first, then scan your penny item.

## Multiple Penny Items? Know the Limit

- You **can** buy multiple units of the **same penny SKU** in one transaction
- **Don't** scan different SKUs together unless you want extra attention
- When in doubt: **one penny SKU per checkout**

If you have 5 of the same penny item, you can scan all 5. But if you have 3 different penny items, consider doing separate transactions or spreading them across multiple visits.

## What If It's in a Locked Case or Cage?

Here's how to play it smart:

1. **Add a "keeper" item to your cart**
2. Ask a staff member to unlock the item
3. Politely direct them toward **self-checkout**
4. At SCO:
   - Scan the keeper item first
   - Then scan the suspected penny item
   - Staff may leave once the item is scanned
5. Pay and print your receipt as usual

This method makes your cart look intentional and reduces suspicion.

## If You're Stopped by an Employee...

Despite all your efforts, you may get flagged.

### Do This:
- **Stay calm and polite**
- Finish payment if possible and **print your receipt**
- If asked about the price, say something like:
  - *"That's just what it scanned for."*
  - *"I found it on the shelf and thought I'd buy it."*

### Do Not:
- Admit you were looking for penny items
- Get angry or argue—that draws attention to the broader practice
- Cause a scene—it's not worth risking future visits

## If They Demand the Item Back After Purchase

You can try one of the following:

- *"I've completed the purchase and have my receipt. I'm not returning it."*
- If pressed, calmly ask: *"Can I speak with a manager for clarification on store policy?"*

Some stores might honor it, others may confiscate it. **Reactions vary from store to store.**

---

## Manager Interaction Tips

- **Stay respectful and avoid confrontation**
- If a manager insists you return the item, weigh your options:
  - Is it worth pushing back?
  - Risking being trespassed from the store?
- If needed, offer to **return extra units and keep one**
- If denied, **walk away quietly**—your reputation matters

Getting banned from a store for one item isn't worth it. You lose access to future finds.

## Legal & Policy Considerations (Briefly)

- Home Depot reserves the right to **correct pricing errors**
- In some states, retailers must **honor posted prices**—but this varies
- There's anecdotal evidence of some managers choosing to **honor a penny price to avoid conflict**

Bottom line: There's no universal rule. Every situation is different.

---

## Final Checkout Tips

- **Act natural**—don't look nervous or excited
- **Don't film or take photos** at checkout
- **Don't brag or show the receipt** to other customers
- **Exit calmly**—don't run out like you just stole something

The more normal you act, the less likely staff will notice or care.
