# Frequently Asked Questions

Got questions? Here are answers to the most common penny hunting questions.

## Basics

### What exactly is a penny item?
A penny item is merchandise that rings up at **$0.01** due to Home Depot's internal inventory clearance system. It's not a sale—it's an item marked for removal that hasn't been pulled from the floor yet.

### Are penny items legal to buy?
Buying a penny item isn't illegal, but **Home Depot can refuse the sale**. Stores reserve the right to correct pricing errors, and many managers will cancel the transaction or demand the item back.

### Can I get in trouble for buying penny items?
You won't face legal trouble, but you **can be banned from the store** if you cause problems, harass staff, or repeatedly try to buy items after being denied.

### Why do penny items exist?
They exist because **retail operations aren't perfect**. Items are supposed to be pulled when they hit $0.01, but oversight, staff backlog, and high volume mean some slip through.

## Finding Penny Items

### Will the app or website show the $0.01 price?
**No.** The penny price never shows online. You can only confirm it by scanning in-store.

### What are the best categories to check?
Common penny categories include:
- Hardware (screws, nails, hooks, brackets)
- Lighting (bulbs, switches, fixtures)
- Electrical parts
- Paint accessories
- Seasonal leftovers
- Discontinued items

### How do I know if an item is about to go penny?
Check the **price ending** on the clearance tag:
- `.03` or `.02` = High chance of going penny soon
- `.06` or `.04` = Medium chance
- `.00` = Still early in the cycle

Also check the **tag date**—items typically move through markdown stages every 1–3 weeks.

### Can I just ask an employee if something is a penny item?
You can, but it's risky. If you ask for a "price check" and it scans at $0.01, the employee will likely pull it from the floor. Better to use **self-checkout** to confirm quietly.

## Buying Penny Items

### What's the best way to check out with a penny item?
**Self-checkout** is your safest option. Scan the **UPC barcode** (not the yellow clearance tag), pay immediately, and print your receipt.

### Should I scan the yellow clearance tag?
**No.** Scanning the clearance tag can freeze the terminal and flag staff. Always scan the manufacturer's UPC barcode.

### Can I buy multiple penny items at once?
You can buy **multiple units of the same SKU** in one transaction. Scanning **different SKUs together** increases the chance of getting flagged.

### What if an employee stops me?
Stay **calm and polite**. If you've already paid, show your receipt and calmly state that the transaction is complete. If they insist, weigh whether it's worth arguing or better to walk away.

## Store Policies & Staff

### Why do employees care so much about penny items?
Because **managers are judged on shrink metrics and inventory control**. Penny items hurt these metrics, so staff are trained to pull them quickly.

### Can employees buy penny items?
**No.** It's against policy and results in **termination**. Many stores also enforce a "24-hour rule" preventing staff from buying newly marked-down clearance.

### What's a FIRST phone?
It's the **orange handheld scanner** used by Home Depot employees for inventory, price checks, and scanning. They can use it to see penny items in the "Clearance App."

### Do all stores enforce the same rules?
**No.** Enforcement varies by store, manager, shift, and even individual employees. One store might honor the sale, another might refuse it entirely.

---

## Price Endings & Clearance Cycles

### What do the price endings mean?
Price endings signal where an item is in the markdown cycle:
- `.00` = First markdown (~10–25% off)
- `.06` or `.04` = Second markdown (~50% off)
- `.03` or `.02` = Final markdown (~75% off)
- `$0.01` = Penny status (system write-off)

### How long does it take for an item to go from clearance to penny?
It depends on the cadence:
- **Cadence A:** ~13 weeks (`.00` → `.06` → `.03` → penny)
- **Cadence B:** ~7 weeks (`.00` → `.04` → `.02` → penny)

But this varies by store and item type.

### Do all clearance items eventually hit $0.01?
**No.** Many items sell out, get pulled, or are liquidated before reaching penny status.

---

## Community & Ethics

### Where can I find lists of known penny items?
Check penny shopping groups on:
- Facebook
- Reddit (search for "penny shopping" or "Home Depot deals")
- Discord servers
- Reseller forums

Always verify dates and locations—penny items don't last long.

### Should I share my finds online?
Yes, but **responsibly**:
- Share UPCs, SKUs, and tag dates
- Post accurate info—not rumors
- Avoid bragging or posting videos that show store locations/staff faces

### Is it okay to leave penny items for others?
It doesn't really matter. If you don't want it, leave it—but the system will flag it for removal soon anyway. Don't expect it to sit there for the next person.

---

## Returns & Receipts

### Can I return a penny item?
Yes, but you'll only get **$0.01 back**—the purchase price. Returns are processed at the price paid, not the original retail price.

### Should I keep my receipt?
**Absolutely.** Your receipt is proof of purchase. If questioned, show it to demonstrate the transaction was completed.

---

## Overhead & Locked Items

### Can I use the yellow ladders to get overhead items?
**Yes**, they're for customer use—but be aware it's **very visible** and may draw attention.

### What about the big orange ladders?
**No.** Those are for employees only. Using them is against store policy and can get you kicked out.

### How do I buy a penny item that's in a locked case?
Add a "keeper" item to your cart, ask staff to unlock it, and direct them to **self-checkout**. Scan the keeper item first, then the penny item after staff leave.

---

## Troubleshooting

### The item didn't scan at $0.01—what happened?
Possibilities:
- It hasn't been marked down yet
- You scanned the wrong barcode
- The system hasn't updated
- Someone else already bought it and the floor stock is stale

### The self-checkout froze when I scanned it—what do I do?
This can happen if you scanned the **clearance tag instead of the UPC**. Restart the transaction and scan the manufacturer's barcode.

### A manager demanded the item back after I paid—what are my rights?
Legally, it varies by state. Some states require retailers to honor scanned prices, others don't. You can politely decline and cite your receipt, but weigh whether it's worth escalating.
