# Clearance Lifecycle & Markdown Cadences

At Home Depot, clearance items follow a **markdown sequence** that may eventually lead to the $0.01 "penny" status.

While unofficial, two distinct markdown patterns—or **Clearance Cadences**—have been consistently observed by shoppers.

## Why This Matters

Understanding these cadences helps you:
- Predict when an item might hit penny status
- Know which items are worth watching
- Time your store visits more effectively
- Avoid wasting time on items nowhere near penny pricing

The key? **Price endings**. They signal where an item is in its markdown lifecycle.

## Clearance Cadence A (Approx. 13 Weeks)

| Stage | Price Ending | Discount | Duration | Notes |
|-------|--------------|----------|----------|-------|
| Initial Markdown | `.00` | ~10–25% off | 4 weeks (est.) | Enters clearance |
| Second Markdown | `.06` | ~50% off | ~6 weeks | Signals progression |
| Final Markdown | `.03` | ~75% off | ~3 weeks | Last stage before removal |
| System Update | N/A | **$0.01** | Internal | If not pulled, system marks as penny item |

## Clearance Cadence B (Approx. 7 Weeks)

| Stage | Price Ending | Discount | Duration | Notes |
|-------|--------------|----------|----------|-------|
| Initial Markdown | `.00` | ~10–25% off | 1–2 weeks | Starts clearance |
| Second Markdown | `.04` | ~50% off | ~4 weeks | Often missed by shoppers |
| Final Markdown | `.02` | ~75% off | ~2 weeks | High likelihood of penny pricing next |
| System Update | N/A | **$0.01** | Internal | System triggers penny status |

## Key Takeaways

- **Price endings matter** — they signal where an item is in its markdown lifecycle
- **Watch the clearance tag date** — use it to estimate when the next drop may happen
- **Don't rely on fixed timing** — while these cadences are common, store exceptions exist

Some items move faster. Some skip stages. Some never hit penny at all. These patterns are guides, not guarantees.

## Quick Reference: Price Ending Cheat Sheet

| Price Ending | What It Means | Chance of Penny |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| `.00` | First markdown, entering clearance | **Low** |
| `.06` | Second markdown (Cadence A) | **Medium** |
| `.03` | Final markdown (Cadence A) | **High** |
| `.04` | Second markdown (Cadence B) | **Medium** |
| `.02` | Final markdown (Cadence B) | **High** |
| `.97` / `.98` | Regular sale price | **Extremely low** |
| Others (e.g., `.56`) | Inconsistent meaning | **Low** — speculative only |

## How to Use This Info

### Step 1: Check the Price Ending
Look at the yellow clearance tag. What's the last two digits of the price?

- If it's `.00` → Still early in the cycle
- If it's `.06` or `.04` → Getting closer
- If it's `.03` or `.02` → Very close—check back soon

### Step 2: Note the Tag Date
The clearance tag usually has an "effective date" showing when the markdown started.

Use that date to estimate when the next drop might happen:
- Cadence A: ~2–3 weeks between drops
- Cadence B: ~1–2 weeks between drops

### Step 3: Decide Whether to Track It
If the item is useful and the price ending is `.03` or `.02`, it's worth checking back in a week or two.

If it's still at `.00`, you might be waiting a month or more—probably not worth the effort unless it's something you really want.

## Important: This Is Not Guaranteed

These cadences are **patterns**, not rules.

Exceptions happen because:
- Some stores move items faster or slower
- Seasonal items get pulled earlier
- Discontinued items may skip stages
- Regional markdowns differ

Use this as a framework, not a crystal ball.
