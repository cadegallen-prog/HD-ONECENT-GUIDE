# In-Store Strategy: The Art of Penny Hunting

Once you're in the store, your goal is to find penny-priced items that haven't yet been pulled from the shelves. These are usually clearance items that slipped through the cracks.

## Where to Look

Start with obvious zones, but don't stop there.

### Primary Hotspots
- **Clearance endcaps** — The most obvious place, but also the most picked over
- **Aisles with yellow tags** — Clearance items are usually marked with yellow stickers
- **Seasonal sections** (especially post-season) — Halloween in November, Christmas in January, etc.

### Hidden Gems
- **Bottom or top shelves** in standard aisles — Items get shoved there and forgotten
- **Back corners or dusty areas** — Low-traffic zones = less likely to be noticed by staff
- **Outdoor garden section** (during seasonal changeovers) — Spring/summer transitions leave a lot behind
- **Misplaced items left by customers** — Someone picked it up, changed their mind, and left it somewhere random

**Pro Tip:** Don't just walk the clearance section and leave. The best finds are often in weird spots—like a single bag of discontinued screws on a random shelf in plumbing.

## What to Look For

Certain categories tend to hit penny status more often:

- **Hardware:** screws, nails, hooks, brackets
- **Lighting:** bulbs, switches, fixtures
- **Electrical parts**
- **Paint accessories**
- **Seasonal leftovers**
- **Discontinued items**
- **Brand transitions** (when a supplier is pulled chain-wide)

**Known Penny Items vs. Store-Specific Pennies:**
- **"Known penny items"** are discussed in online communities and often go chain-wide (same SKU pennies at multiple stores)
- **"Store-specific" pennies** usually result from returns, overstock, or untracked markdowns (one-off finds)

Both are worth hunting, but known items have higher success rates if you're early.

## How to Check the Price (Discreetly)

### Best Method: Self-Checkout (SCO)

1. Go to a self-checkout terminal with the item in hand
2. Scan the **manufacturer's UPC barcode**—not the yellow clearance sticker
3. If it scans at $0.01, pay at once and print your receipt
4. Stay low-key—don't draw attention to the screen

**Warning:** Scanning the clearance tag can freeze the terminal and flag an employee.

### Backup Method: Ask for a Stock Check

If you must ask an employee:

- Look for one using a **FIRST phone** (orange handheld scanner)
- Say: **"Can you do a stock check on this?"**—not a price check
- Give them the SKU or show the UPC barcode
- Watch the screen discreetly: if it shows **$0.01**, **"0" quantity**, or an **error**—it's probably pennied

**Note:** Don't leave the item behind while you check. It could disappear or be pulled.

## Overhead Items: High-Risk, Mixed Results

Items stored **overhead** (on top shelves) present a unique challenge—and some real risks.

Here's what you need to know:

### Customer-Accessible Ladders

The **small yellow ladders** (often in the paint section) are for customer use.

You can use these to retrieve overhead items—just know:
- They're usually visible
- Using them will draw attention
- If you're trying to be discreet, this isn't ideal

### Big Orange Ladders

These are **strictly for employees**.

Using them as a customer is **against store policy**.

If you decide to use one anyway:
- Understand the risk: it's much more visible and potentially escalates quickly
- Only do this as a last resort

---

### Asking for Help (Roll the Dice)

You can ask an employee to retrieve an overhead item.

**BUT:** There's a **50/50 chance they'll scan it first**.

If it scans at $0.01, they'll likely say: **"This can't be sold"**

That item will now be removed from the floor entirely.

**Pro Tip:** If you ask, be polite and casual. If it's denied—let it go. Causing a scene alerts staff to penny activity and can ruin your future hunts.

## General In-Store Tips

- **Go during off-peak hours** — Early mornings or late evenings mean fewer staff and customers
- **Don't look suspicious** — Act like a normal shopper. Bring a cart. Browse normally.
- **Don't hover around clearance sections too long** — Staff will notice
- **Don't ask too many employees** — If one says no, move on. Asking multiple people raises flags.
- **Keep your finds low-key** — Don't show them off or talk about them in the store
