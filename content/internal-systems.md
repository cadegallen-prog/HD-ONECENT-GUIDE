# Internal Systems: How Home Depot Handles Penny Items

Understanding Home Depot's internal operations will help you grasp **why penny items exist**, **why staff act the way they do**, and **how the system works behind the scenes**.

## Penny Items = Not Meant for Sale

Home Depot doesn't price things at $0.01 for customers—it's an **internal accounting mechanism** triggered by **Zero Margin Adjustment (ZMA)**.

### Why does it happen:
- Item is **discontinued, damaged, expired, or no longer worth selling**
- Store uses ZMA to reduce its system value to $0.01 (effectively zero)
- System **flags it for removal** from shelves—but sometimes it gets missed

If it's still on the floor, it's likely due to **oversight or staff backlog**.

## Employee Policy: Strict Rules on Penny Items

Employees are **forbidden from buying penny items**.

Doing so results in **termination**.

Many stores also enforce a **"24-hour rule"**:
- Staff can't buy any newly marked-down clearance item until it's been on the floor for **24+ hours**
- This prevents staff from hiding items for themselves

The company takes this seriously. Employees who violate this risk losing their jobs.

## FIRST Phones & the Clearance App

Home Depot equips staff with handheld devices called **FIRST phones**. These are used for scanning, inventory, and price checks.

### Key App: Clearance App

Used by associates to:
- See a list of **clearance items, including penny-priced ones**
- Filter by **department, location, price, on-hand stock, and "no home" items**
- **Flag items for removal**

This tool helps staff **actively search for and remove penny items** from the sales floor.

If you see an employee walking around with a FIRST phone scanning random items, they might be running the clearance app to pull pennies.

## Why Management Cares So Much

Managers are pressured to remove penny items because they:

- **Hurt shrink metrics** (loss due to theft, damage, system errors)
- **Signal poor inventory control**
- **Represent a financial loss** (even at a penny, the system records a transaction)
- **Disrupt inventory accuracy** for automation and reorders

Stores are **judged on these metrics**, so managers actively try to stop penny sales from happening.

A store with lots of penny sales looks like it has poor inventory management—which reflects badly on the manager's performance review.

## SOP Reality: Policy vs. Practice

Home Depot may have internal **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** around penny items, but **enforcement varies**:

- Some managers will **quietly honor the sale** to avoid escalation
- Others will **confiscate the item or cancel the transaction**
- Some employees may even give it away as a **"damaged out" freebie**—rare, but it happens

It all depends on:
- The manager
- Staff training
- Store culture

**Same store, different shifts = different outcomes.**

One manager might let you walk out with a penny item. Another might call security. There's no universal policy.

---

## Bottom Line: Stay Under the Radar

- Penny items **aren't supposed to be sold**
- Stores are trained to **remove them fast**
- If you manage to buy one, it's often due to a **gap in the system**

The more attention you draw, the harder stores will crack down. Play it smart, stay respectful, and keep it low-key.
