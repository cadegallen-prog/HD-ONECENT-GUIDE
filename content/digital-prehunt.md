# Digital Pre-Hunt: Using the Home Depot App & Website

Before heading into a store, use Home Depot's app or website to scout items that might have reached penny status.

**Important:** The app won't show you the $0.01 price directly—but it **can** give you signals that an item has been marked internally.

---

## Step 1: Set Your Store Location

In the app or online, **set your specific store location** before searching.

Why this matters:
- Inventory and pricing data is **store-specific**
- Wrong location = wrong info
- An item might be pennied at Store A but still full price at Store B

**How to set it:**
- Open the Home Depot app or website
- Tap the location icon or "My Store" dropdown
- Select the exact store you plan to visit

---

## Step 2: Search by SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)

Find the **SKU number** on:
- Product packaging
- Yellow clearance tag
- Community posts (if someone shared a known penny item)

Use that number in the Home Depot app or site search bar.

**Pro Tip:** Searching by SKU is more accurate than searching by product name, which can pull up similar but unrelated items.

## Step 3: Interpret What You See

Once you've searched an item, use the chart below to decode what the listing might mean:

| Online Status | What It Could Mean |
|---------------|-------------------|
| **In Stock + Clearance Price visible** | Still in clearance cycle, not pennied yet |
| **In Stock + Full Price** | Still active inventory |
| **Out of Stock / Unavailable / Ship to Store Only + Full Price** | **Strong penny candidate** — system may have pennied it, but it hasn't been removed from shelves yet |
| **Clearance price still showing online** | Not yet a penny item |

**Key Insight:** If the system shows a **full price** but **no stock**, it might have already hit $0.01 internally and just hasn't been pulled.

## Limitations to Keep in Mind

Digital scouting is helpful, but it's not foolproof.

- **Online data isn't real-time** — there can be a delay of 1–2 days
- **The penny price ($0.01) never shows online**
- **You still need in-store confirmation to be sure** — this is just a filtering step

Don't make a special trip based solely on app data. Use it to narrow down which stores and items are worth checking in person.

---

## When to Go In-Store

Only go check in person if:

- You've found an item that shows **no local stock** but is still listed online
- You're tracking the item based on its **clearance cycle and tag date**
- You've seen reports in **penny shopping communities** about that item pennying out recently

If the item shows in stock at full clearance price, it's probably not pennied yet. Wait and check again in a week or two.

---

## Advanced Tip: Track Multiple Stores

If you live near multiple Home Depot locations, check the app for the same SKU across all of them.

Why? Because:
- One store might penny an item while another still has it at full price
- Store-specific returns or overstock can trigger penny status at one location only
- Seasonal changeovers happen at different speeds per store

Switch your "My Store" location in the app and search again. Compare inventory status across stores to find the best candidate.
