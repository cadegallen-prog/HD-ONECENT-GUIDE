        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <p></p>
        <p>Got questions? Here are answers to the most common penny hunting questions.</p>
        <p></p>
        <hr>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Basics</h2>
        <p></p>
        <h3>What exactly is a penny item?</h3>
        <p>A penny item is merchandise that rings up at <strong>$0.01</strong> due to Home Depot's internal inventory clearance system. It's not a sale—it's an item marked for removal that hasn't been pulled from the floor yet.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Are penny items legal to buy?</h3>
        <p>Buying a penny item isn't illegal, but <strong>Home Depot can refuse the sale</strong>. Stores reserve the right to correct pricing errors, and many managers will cancel the transaction or demand the item back.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Can I get in trouble for buying penny items?</h3>
        <p>You won't face legal trouble, but you <strong>can be banned from the store</strong> if you cause problems, harass staff, or repeatedly try to buy items after being denied.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Why do penny items exist?</h3>
        <p>They exist because <strong>retail operations aren't perfect</strong>. Items are supposed to be pulled when they hit $0.01, but oversight, staff backlog, and high volume mean some slip through.</p>
        <p></p>
        <hr>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Finding Penny Items</h2>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Will the app or website show the $0.01 price?</h3>
        <p><strong>No.</strong> The penny price never shows online. You can only confirm it by scanning in-store.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>What are the best categories to check?</h3>
        <p>Common penny categories include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Hardware (screws, nails, hooks, brackets)</li>
        <li>Lighting (bulbs, switches, fixtures)</li>
        <li>Electrical parts</li>
        <li>Paint accessories</li>
        <li>Seasonal leftovers</li>
        <li>Discontinued items</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h3>How do I know if an item is about to go penny?</h3>
        <p>Check the <strong>price ending</strong> on the clearance tag:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><code>.03</code> or <code>.02</code> = High chance of going penny soon</li>
        <li><code>.06</code> or <code>.04</code> = Medium chance</li>
        <li><code>.00</code> = Still early in the cycle</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>Also check the <strong>tag date</strong>—items typically move through markdown stages every 1–3 weeks.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Can I just ask an employee if something is a penny item?</h3>
        <p>You can, but it's risky. If you ask for a "price check" and it scans at $0.01, the employee will likely pull it from the floor. Better to use <strong>self-checkout</strong> to confirm quietly.</p>
        <p></p>
        <hr>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Buying Penny Items</h2>
        <p></p>
        <h3>What's the best way to check out with a penny item?</h3>
        <p><strong>Self-checkout</strong> is your safest option. Scan the <strong>UPC barcode</strong> (not the yellow clearance tag), pay immediately, and print your receipt.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Should I scan the yellow clearance tag?</h3>
        <p><strong>No.</strong> Scanning the clearance tag can freeze the terminal and flag staff. Always scan the manufacturer's UPC barcode.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Can I buy multiple penny items at once?</h3>
        <p>You can buy <strong>multiple units of the same SKU</strong> in one transaction. Scanning <strong>different SKUs together</strong> increases the chance of getting flagged.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>What if an employee stops me?</h3>
        <p>Stay <strong>calm and polite</strong>. If you've already paid, show your receipt and calmly state that the transaction is complete. If they insist, weigh whether it's worth arguing or better to walk away.</p>
        <p></p>
        <hr>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Store Policies & Staff</h2>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Why do employees care so much about penny items?</h3>
        <p>Because <strong>managers are judged on shrink metrics and inventory control</strong>. Penny items hurt these metrics, so staff are trained to pull them quickly.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Can employees buy penny items?</h3>
        <p><strong>No.</strong> It's against policy and results in <strong>termination</strong>. Many stores also enforce a "24-hour rule" preventing staff from buying newly marked-down clearance.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>What's a FIRST phone?</h3>
        <p>It's the <strong>orange handheld scanner</strong> used by Home Depot employees for inventory, price checks, and scanning. They can use it to see penny items in the "Clearance App."</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Do all stores enforce the same rules?</h3>
        <p><strong>No.</strong> Enforcement varies by store, manager, shift, and even individual employees. One store might honor the sale, another might refuse it entirely.</p>
        <p></p>
        <hr>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Price Endings & Clearance Cycles</h2>
        <p></p>
        <h3>What do the price endings mean?</h3>
        <p>Price endings signal where an item is in the markdown cycle:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><code>.00</code> = First markdown (~10–25% off)</li>
        <li><code>.06</code> or <code>.04</code> = Second markdown (~50% off)</li>
        <li><code>.03</code> or <code>.02</code> = Final markdown (~75% off)</li>
        <li><code>$0.01</code> = Penny status (system write-off)</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h3>How long does it take for an item to go from clearance to penny?</h3>
        <p>It depends on the cadence:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Cadence A:</strong> ~13 weeks (<code>.00</code> → <code>.06</code> → <code>.03</code> → penny)</li>
        <li><strong>Cadence B:</strong> ~7 weeks (<code>.00</code> → <code>.04</code> → <code>.02</code> → penny)</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>But this varies by store and item type.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Do all clearance items eventually hit $0.01?</h3>
        <p><strong>No.</strong> Many items sell out, get pulled, or are liquidated before reaching penny status.</p>
        <p></p>
        <hr>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Community & Ethics</h2>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Where can I find lists of known penny items?</h3>
        <p>Check penny shopping groups on:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Facebook</li>
        <li>Reddit (search for "penny shopping" or "Home Depot deals")</li>
        <li>Discord servers</li>
        <li>Reseller forums</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>Always verify dates and locations—penny items don't last long.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Should I share my finds online?</h3>
        <p>Yes, but <strong>responsibly</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Share UPCs, SKUs, and tag dates</li>
        <li>Post accurate info—not rumors</li>
        <li>Avoid bragging or posting videos that show store locations/staff faces</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Is it okay to leave penny items for others?</h3>
        <p>It doesn't really matter. If you don't want it, leave it—but the system will flag it for removal soon anyway. Don't expect it to sit there for the next person.</p>
        <p></p>
        <hr>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Returns & Receipts</h2>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Can I return a penny item?</h3>
        <p>Yes, but you'll only get <strong>$0.01 back</strong>—the purchase price. Returns are processed at the price paid, not the original retail price.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Should I keep my receipt?</h3>
        <p><strong>Absolutely.</strong> Your receipt is proof of purchase. If questioned, show it to demonstrate the transaction was completed.</p>
        <p></p>
        <hr>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Overhead & Locked Items</h2>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Can I use the yellow ladders to get overhead items?</h3>
        <p><strong>Yes</strong>, they're for customer use—but be aware it's <strong>very visible</strong> and may draw attention.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>What about the big orange ladders?</h3>
        <p><strong>No.</strong> Those are for employees only. Using them is against store policy and can get you kicked out.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>How do I buy a penny item that's in a locked case?</h3>
        <p>Add a "keeper" item to your cart, ask staff to unlock it, and direct them to <strong>self-checkout</strong>. Scan the keeper item first, then the penny item after staff leave.</p>
        <p></p>
        <hr>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <p></p>
        <h3>The item didn't scan at $0.01—what happened?</h3>
        <p>Possibilities:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>It hasn't been marked down yet</li>
        <li>You scanned the wrong barcode</li>
        <li>The system hasn't updated</li>
        <li>Someone else already bought it and the floor stock is stale</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h3>The self-checkout froze when I scanned it—what do I do?</h3>
        <p>This can happen if you scanned the <strong>clearance tag instead of the UPC</strong>. Restart the transaction and scan the manufacturer's barcode.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>A manager demanded the item back after I paid—what are my rights?</h3>
        <p>Legally, it varies by state. Some states require retailers to honor scanned prices, others don't. You can politely decline and cite your receipt, but weigh whether it's worth escalating.</p>
