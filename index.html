    <h2>What You'll Learn</h2>

    <p>This guide covers everything you need to know about penny hunting at Home Depot:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>What penny items are</strong> (and what they're not)</li>
      <li><strong>How clearance cycles work</strong> and how items become penny-priced</li>
      <li><strong>Digital pre-hunt strategies</strong> using the Home Depot app and website</li>
      <li><strong>In-store tactics</strong> for finding items that haven't been pulled yet</li>
      <li><strong>Checkout methods</strong> that actually work (and what to avoid)</li>
      <li><strong>Internal systems</strong> that drive the whole process behind the scenes</li>
      <li><strong>Facts vs. myths</strong> to help you separate reality from wishful thinking</li>
      <li><strong>Responsible hunting</strong> so you don't ruin it for everyone else</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>No Guru BS—Just Real Info</h2>

    <p>This isn't a "secret sale" guide or some exclusive insider hack. Penny items exist because of gaps in Home Depot's inventory removal process—nothing more.</p>

    <p>Everything here is based on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Consistent community observations</li>
      <li>Shared receipts and screenshots</li>
      <li>Retail clearance logic</li>
      <li>Trial and error from real shoppers</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Important:</strong> This guide reflects what the penny shopping community has learned over time. It's not official Home Depot policy, and practices vary by store.</p>

    <h2>Is This for You?</h2>

    <p>If you're looking for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A get-rich-quick scheme → this isn't it</li>
      <li>Guaranteed finds every trip → not happening</li>
      <li>Risk-free shopping → there are no guarantees</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But if you're willing to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn how the system works</li>
      <li>Put in the time and effort</li>
      <li>Stay patient through dry spells</li>
      <li>Act respectfully in stores</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Then you're in the right place.</p>

    <h2>Final Heads-Up</h2>

    <p>Penny items aren't meant to be sold. They're marked for removal. If you manage to buy one, it's because something slipped through the cracks.</p>

    <p>Stores are actively trained to pull these items and stop these sales. Your success depends on staying low-key, respectful, and smart about it.</p>
