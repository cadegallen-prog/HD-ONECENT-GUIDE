Penny Central – Revised Execution Plan for Growth
& Engagement
Based on your feedback, this plan emphasizes quick wins, community growth, and a light-touch approach. We
defer complex moderation features and focus on boosting user submissions, habit-forming features, repeat visits,
and searchability – all while keeping maintenance under ~5 hours/week. Below are step-by-step actions broken
into weekly sprints for the first month, followed by high-level milestones through month 6.

Week 1: Unify Data & Retire the Old “Verified” List
Goal: Merge all penny item data into a single community-driven list and eliminate duplicate pages, laying a
simple, trustworthy foundation.

• Import Verified Finds into the Penny List: Consolidate your 482 admin-verified penny items into
the community Google Sheet so everything lives in one list. 

• Data Export/Conversion: Extract your existing verified items (e.g. from verified-
pennies.json ) and convert each purchase date into a separate entry. This means if an item was
found 5 times, it will generate 5 rows – ensuring the Penny List reflects multiple confirmations
(boosts credibility). 

• Bulk Upload to Google Sheet: Use a script or tool to append these entries to the Google Form’s
response sheet (to avoid manual data entry). Leverage your AI coding assistant to generate a one-off
script for this task.
AI Prompt (script generation example): “I have a JSON file of verified penny items (with fields SKU, name,
dates, etc.). Write a Python script to read it and output a CSV (or use Google Sheets API) where each
purchase date becomes a separate row with SKU, name, date, and an ‘Imported’ note in the Notes field.”

• Verify on the Site: After importing, deploy the updated data and check the Penny List page. You
should see all historical items now included (with their original find dates). Each SKU with multiple
reports will show an aggregated count (e.g. “5 total reports”) and multi-state labels if applicable – the
site logic already handles this 1 2 . Confirm that images load for those items (the code cross-
references your JSON for product images 3 ), and that the list still functions normally with the
larger dataset.

• Retire the Old “Verified Pennies” Page: Eliminate confusion by having one unified list. 
• Remove Navigation Link: Edit your site header/navigation to remove the link to the old “Verified

Pennies” page (if present). This ensures new visitors focus on the Penny List. 
• Set Up Redirect: If users might still visit the old URL, create a redirect from /verified-pennies

to /penny-list . In Next.js App Router, you can do this by creating a file at app/verified-
pennies/page.tsx  that performs a redirect('/')  to the new list, or by adding a rewrite in 
next.config.js .

AI Prompt (Next.js redirect example): “In Next.js, how can I redirect a removed route (/verified-pennies) to /
penny-list? Show a sample using Next 13 App Router.”



• Migration Note: If feasible, add a one-line note in your Penny List or homepage about the merge
(e.g. “We've merged our old verified list into this community list for one comprehensive resource”).
This transparency builds trust that nothing was lost in the transition.

• Normalize Display Fields: Ensure the Penny List UI treats all items uniformly, now that data comes
from both your imports and new user submissions. 

• If the old Verified list had extra fields (Brand, Model, etc.) that community entries lack, adjust the
front-end to omit those fields in list view to avoid empty gaps 4 . For example, you might remove
the brand/model labels on the list cards if many new entries don’t have them. All items should follow
the same format and style, so a casual user can’t tell which came from you versus the community. 

• Quick UX fix: Continue hiding any “quantity” or “units found” field (as you already do) to keep
focus on how many people found an item, not how many each person grabbed 5 . This avoids any
competitive or spammy vibe.

• Lightweight Moderation Setup: Keep moderation manual and minimal at this stage. The required 
photo proof on the Google Form remains your first and only “gate” for now – no additional
automated checks. Trust the community signals (duplicate SKUs across regions) to surface real deals

6 . 
• Ensure Auto-Publish: Verify that your site is pulling all form submissions by default (no “Approved =

TRUE” filter active). In your Google Sheet or fetch code, the Approved  column should be ignored
unless you decide to use it later 7 . This way new reports show up immediately without your
intervention, keeping the list real-time. 

• Safety Net (for later): If spam becomes an issue down the road, you can toggle on approval filtering
easily. For now, plan to monitor submissions daily (a quick scan of the sheet or site) but don’t hold
entries for review – this keeps your maintenance low and the community empowered. (Remember:
“keep moderation as lightweight as possible… use safety nets only if necessary” 8 .)

Week 1 Resources: Google Sheets (for data import), Next.js codebase (for removing page &
redirect), AI coding assistant (for scripting the import and quick code changes). Time budget:
~5 hours. Most of this is a one-time setup; once done, you’ll have a single up-to-date Penny
List with all historical data, and you can move faster on improvements.

Week 2: UI/UX Refinements for Speed & Clarity
Goal: Make the Penny List easier to scan and navigate, improving user experience and encouraging repeat
visits (without adding complexity).

• Adopt a Compact List Layout: Reduce the visual bulk of list items so users can see more at a
glance, especially on mobile. Your “Hot Right Now” section already uses a smaller card design;
extend that style to the main list for consistency and faster browsing 9 . 

• Identify the component (or prop) for compact cards. (It looks like you have a 
PennyListCardCompact  used for trending items 9 .) Apply this compact style to all Penny List

entries by default. This may involve adjusting the penny-list-card.tsx  or swapping in the
compact component in the list rendering code. 

• Test the list after changes: each item card should still display key info (SKU, product name, report
count, states, date) but in a tighter format. Scroll both on desktop and mobile to ensure the list feels
denser but still readable (no tiny text or taps). Users should now be able to see more items per
screen, making the experience feel “faster” and more content-rich.





• Keep styling consistent with your design system (no new colors or fonts). The goal is a subtle CSS/
layout tweak for efficiency, not a full redesign.
AI Prompt (UI update example): “Refactor the Penny List to use the compact card design globally. For
instance, use the existing PennyListCardCompact component (from Hot Right Now) for all list items. Ensure
all original info is still shown. Provide the code changes.”

• Add an “All-Time” Filter Option: Let power-users (and search engines) see older penny finds easily.
Currently, the date filter maxes out at 12 months. Introduce an “All” time range so users can view
the full archive if desired 10 11 . 

• Implement Filter Logic: In your filter component ( penny-list-filters.tsx ), add an option for
“All” (or “All Time”). This likely means updating the dropdown options and handling a special value
(e.g. dateRange = "all" ). In the data-fetch logic, if this value is selected, skip the date filtering
so that the entire dataset is shown. 

• Testing: Try selecting “All”. The list might grow to hundreds of items, so check performance. A few
hundred rows should be fine; if it ever grows very large (thousands of entries), you might later
consider pagination or lazy-loading (but defer this unless it’s truly needed). For now, ensure that “All”
successfully displays older items without timeouts. If the page gets sluggish with everything, you
could set a limit like 24 months for the “All” option – but only do so if necessary. 

• Discoverability: Make sure this new filter is obvious. Users interested in history or patterns will
appreciate an “All” or archive view. Also, consider adding a Year dropdown or pre-set ranges (2023,
2024, etc.) later if the dataset becomes very large; this is not urgent now, just a future enhancement. 
AI Prompt (filter code example): “In the Penny List filter component, add an ‘All time’ option. Update the
filtering logic so if selected, no date range is applied. Show code for both the filter UI and the condition in
data processing.”

• Streamline Date Display (optional tweak): Your list currently shows relative dates (“Today”, “X days
ago”), which is great for freshness. Keep this if users like it – it provides a quick sense of recency. If
you ever find the relative labels too prominent or confusing, you could switch to a subtle absolute
date (e.g. “11/18/25” in small font) 12 . For now, no change is required unless you’ve observed user
confusion. The key is that date info should be present but not overpowering.
Tip: Whether you use relative or absolute dates, maintain the HTML <time datetime="...">
element for SEO. This ensures search engines still get the exact dates.

• Optimize for Speed and Mobile: With more data on the page and a compact layout, double-check
that the site remains snappy and mobile-friendly. 

• Performance check: Load the Penny List on a mobile device or using dev tools throttling. It should
load within a couple of seconds and scrolling should be smooth. If images are a bottleneck, ensure
you’re using optimized thumbnails (it looks like you already use 64px thumbnails from HD’s CDN in
the JSON 13 , which is good). 

• Mobile UX: Confirm that tap targets (like filter dropdowns or any buttons) are comfortably large and
that nothing is cut off on smaller screens. Adjust margins/padding if needed so that cards don’t
overflow. This keeps the experience pleasant, encouraging users to browse longer and return often.

• No new complexity: Avoid any heavy scripts or libraries that could slow things down. The site’s
simplicity is a strength – continue to lean on Next.js SSR and static assets for speed. Everything
you’ve added this week (layout CSS and filter logic) should be very low overhead.

Week 2 Resources: Next.js components ( penny-list-card.tsx , filter components), dev
tools for testing responsive design, AI assistant for quick coding. Time: ~3–5 hours. These UI
improvements  are  mostly  one-time  adjustments  that  make  the  site  easier  to  use  (which
translates to happier users and more repeat visits) without adding maintenance work.




Week 3: Drive Community Engagement & Repeat Visits
Goal: Start  actively  growing  usage  of  the  Penny  List  through  habit-forming  features  and  community
outreach. This week is about getting people to come back regularly and contribute more.

• Highlight “What’s New” to Foster a Habit Loop: Implement a simple freshness indicator that
gives visitors a reason to check the site daily. A great approach is a summary at the top of the Penny
List like: “  X new reports in the last 24 hours; Y in the last 30 days.” This provides instant context and
excitement around new finds 14 15 . 

• Add a server-rendered summary block above the list or filters. Calculate X  as the count of
submissions in the past 24 hours, and Y  as the count in the past 30 days, using your validRows
(or equivalent) array 14 16 . You might have already built this in a Phase 1 plan; if not, it’s
straightforward. 

• Keep the design simple (plain text or a subtle highlight) – no flashy badges needed. The goal is
information density: users immediately see how active the list is today, which encourages them to
revisit frequently (“What dropped since I last checked?”). 

• Example implementation: At build time (or server-side), compute the counts and inject a sentence at
the top of the page. Make sure it updates whenever new data comes in (if you revalidate or refresh
daily).
AI Prompt (freshness summary example): “Add a server-side computed summary to Penny List page: ‘X new
in last 24h; Y total in 30 days.’ Use the submissions data to count entries from last 1 day and 30 days.
Return the HTML snippet to display this above the filters.”

• Result: Visitors get a quick pulse of activity, which builds a routine (“daily Penny Central check-in”)
and trust that the site is actively updated. This is a lightweight feature with big impact on repeat
engagement.

• Promote the Penny List to Your Community: Now that the unified Penny List is live and polished,
draw in your existing audience (Facebook group, etc.) and encourage them to use it. Leverage your
social channels with minimal effort: 

• Facebook Group Post: Make a pinned post or announcement highlighting the new Penny List.
Explain in one or two sentences that “Penny Central now has a live, community-driven penny list
updated daily!” Emphasize how easy it is to check what’s new (and contribute their finds via the form).
Include a direct link to the Penny List page. This will drive your most interested users to start using
(and trusting) the site. 

• Quick Guide Update: On your site’s Guide or About page, add a note about the new system: e.g. 
“Our penny list is now powered by user reports – see something in your store? Submit it and help update
the list for everyone!” Encourage a sense of community contribution. This not only brings in more
submissions but also signals that the site is collaborative (which can increase trust in the data over
time, since people know multiple shoppers are involved). 

• Social Teasers: Occasionally (say once a week), post a little teaser: e.g. “Hot penny find this week: [Item
Name] – 5 reports across 3 states!  Check the Penny List for details.” Such updates spark interest and
remind people to check the site, without you having to manually compile full lists.

• Low Effort, High Impact: These communication tasks take maybe 10–15 minutes each, yet they
significantly boost traffic and submissions if done consistently. They create a feedback loop: more
users → more reports → more content on the site → more users.
(Maintenance note: Set aside a small weekly slot to interact with the community, answer questions, and
gently promote the site. This keeps growth steady with negligible cost.)





• Encourage User Habit Loops: Beyond the freshness summary and social posts, consider other small
nudges to keep users coming back: 

• Homepage Teaser: Add a snippet on your homepage that surfaces the Penny List activity. For
example, in the hero section or a prominent spot on home, display a line like “  Live Penny List: X new
deals reported in the last day!” with a link to the list. This catches any visitor’s eye and funnels them
into the list. You can reuse the same X  and Y  metrics from the Penny List page to avoid extra
work 17 .
AI Prompt (homepage teaser example): “Insert a dynamic text on the homepage that shows the number of
new penny reports in last 24h (use the same logic from Penny List page). Provide the code to fetch the
count (maybe by calling the sheet or an API) and render it with a link to /penny-list.”

• Submission Thank-You Loop: After someone submits a find via the form, redirect them to a nice
thank-you page or message encouraging them to check the list later to see it live. (Google Forms lets
you set a redirect or confirmation message.) A friendly note like “Thanks for your report! It will appear
on the Penny List shortly. Keep an eye on the list to see community finds.” can close the loop and prompt
them to return.

• Feedback Channel: Add a subtle link or footer text: “See something inaccurate? Let us know.” You
already have a feedback widget/component 18  – use it to let users flag any incorrect entries. This
way, the community helps moderate itself. For now, an email link or simple form for feedback is
enough; you don’t need a full voting system yet. It’s an extra safety net that requires minimal
oversight on your part (you’ll just get notified if something’s reported as wrong). 

• Set Up Basic Analytics: If you haven’t already, integrate a lightweight analytics tool (e.g. Google
Analytics or a privacy-friendly alternative like Plausible/Fathom). This will help you track growth
metrics: daily active users, pageviews, popular pages, etc. Knowing these numbers is important to
evaluate success of your engagement efforts. 

• Quick Integration: Google Analytics can be added by pasting a script into your Next.js _app  or
using a simple plugin. This should take less than 30 minutes. (Ensure it doesn’t bloat your site or
slow it down – GA’s script is fairly small, or use Plausible for an even smaller footprint.) 

• Metrics to Watch: Monitor submissions per week, Penny List page views, and bounce rate. If you
see rising usage and submissions, that’s validation to stick to the plan. If not, you can adjust your
outreach or site features accordingly.
(Maintenance: Checking analytics can be a 5-minute weekly task. It’s optional but highly recommended to
inform your decisions.)

Week 3 Resources: Report-a-find settings (for thank-you message), Next.js (for homepage
snippet),  Facebook/Instagram or  other  social  accounts  (for  outreach),  Google Analytics  or
similar.  Time: ~4 hours (a couple hours coding the freshness block and homepage teaser, <1
hour  for  analytics  setup,  ~1  hour  for  crafting  posts/content).  This  investment  should
significantly boost user engagement and return visits, all with tools that require little ongoing
effort.





Week 4: Monitor, Support, and Iterate (Low Overhead)
Goal: By week 4, the core system is in place. This week focuses on maintenance and small fixes: keeping
an eye on data quality, smoothing out any UX rough edges, and ensuring scalability plans are in place. It’s
about reinforcing trust and reliability now that more users are on board.

• Regularly Monitor Submissions: Make it a habit this week to check the Google Sheet and Penny List
at least a few times. You’re looking for any obvious spam or errors now that more people may be
contributing. 

• If you spot a fake or low-quality entry (rare, but possible), manually remove or hide it. Since we
haven’t enabled an approval queue, you can simply delete the row from the Google Sheet or add a
note in a separate “Admin” column to ignore. Because this is manual, do it only for clear-cut cases. So
far, requiring a photo should have prevented most trolls 19 . 

• If prank submissions ramp up (unlikely in a niche community, but be prepared), revisit moderation
settings. This might mean turning on the “Approved” checkbox process for a while. You can start
reviewing new entries and only approving the legit ones 7 . However, this is a last resort if quality
really suffers. The ideal is to keep open submissions flowing and intervene only when needed. 

• Check for duplicate submissions of the same SKU by the same user (less harmful, but if it clutters
the list, you might consolidate or remove exact dupes). Your code already aggregates identical SKUs
from multiple users into one list item, so duplicates mostly just increment the count and are fine.

• Address UX Snags and Bugs: Spend time clicking around the site as a user, especially after the
changes. Look for anything confusing or broken and fix it. For example: 

• Do filter dropdowns and search work correctly with the newly expanded data? (Test combining the
state filter with the new “All time” range, etc.) 

• Are item cards displaying all the info consistently (no missing fields or mismatched formatting)? If
you imported data, maybe some entries lack a state or have slight naming differences – consider
cleaning those up (either in the sheet or via code normalization) so everything looks tidy. 

• Test the site on different devices and browsers if possible. Ensure the compact layout still looks good
on Safari, Chrome, etc., and that dark mode (if you have one) hasn’t been impacted by the UI tweaks.

• Fixes: Tackle any minor layout issues (e.g. if a card’s text overflows) or functionality bugs (e.g. filter
edge-cases) discovered. These should be quick CSS or logic adjustments. 

• Technical Debt Check: If there were any “TODO”s or hacky shortcuts in the rushed changes (like
hardcoded values, etc.), clean them up now. This keeps the codebase healthy and reduces the
chance of future bugs. AI Prompt (bugfix example): “I notice that on mobile the filter dropdown goes off-
screen. How can I adjust the CSS in penny-list-filters.tsx  to make it responsive? Provide the code
change.” (Use similar targeted prompts for any issue you find.)

• Evaluate Growth & Plan Next Steps: With ~1 month of data and usage, reflect on how things are
going before moving to monthly cadence: 

• Engagement metrics: Check your analytics: How many people are using the Penny List daily/
weekly? Are they spending time on it (scrolling, clicking filters)? A positive trend (even if small
numbers) is a green light to continue investing. Flat or no usage might mean you need to promote
more or tweak the value prop (but assume some growth if you followed the steps). 

• Submission flow: How many new submissions came in this month? If it’s very few, identify
bottlenecks. Maybe users are shy or unaware – your Week 3 outreach should help, but consider if
the submission form UX could be improved (more on that in Month 2). Also, verify that form and
sheet integrations are running smoothly (no broken fields, images accessible, etc.). 





• Trust & quality: Gauge community sentiment (if you have comments on social media or feedback
form responses). Are people generally trusting the list? Any complaints about inaccurate items or
missing info? Address any common concerns. For example, if someone says “I wish I knew how old
an entry is,” you might ensure the date is clearly shown (which we did). Or if they ask “can I get
alerted for my state’s finds,” note that as a future feature idea (see Month 2/3).

• Scalability: Your current setup (Next.js + Google Sheets) should comfortably handle the current
traffic and data volume. By end of month 1, you likely have on the order of a few hundred entries.
This is fine. Just keep in mind, if you start seeing thousands of submissions, you may need to
optimize or upgrade the backend down the line. For now, everything is within free, low-maintenance
limits. 

• Jot down any enhancements or fixes that didn’t make it in this month and prioritize them for the
coming months. For example, maybe you haven’t yet embedded a nicer form or added state-specific
pages – put them on the roadmap if you think they’ll add value.

Week 4 Resources: Primarily your own site (for testing) and the Google Sheet. Possibly your
AI dev for any quick fixes. Time: ~3 hours of testing/tweaking spread through the week. This
ensures the project stays healthy and stress-free, aligning with your 5 hr/week limit. By the
end of Week 4, you should have a smoothly running community penny list and a good sense
of what to focus on next.

Month 2: Boost Submissions & UX (Minimal Overhead
Enhancements)
Milestone: After the first month’s foundation, Month 2 is about increasing contributions and refining the
experience without adding much maintenance. We’ll make it easier for users to submit finds and navigate
content, and continue growing our user base.

• Improve the Submission Experience (if needed): Review how the Google Form is working. If you
notice drop-offs (people clicking “Submit a Find” but not completing), consider streamlining this step.
Two potential improvements:


• SEO & Content Findability: Start making Penny Central more discoverable via search engines:
• Ensure indexing: Verify that your Penny List page (and other key pages) are being indexed by

Google/Bing. You can use Google Search Console (free) to check coverage. Given your site is SSR with




static content, it should index well. The fresh content (new finds) and the fact that SKUs and product
names are text on the page is good for SEO. 

• Add an Archive Page (for SEO and UX): Create a simple “Penny Archive” page that lists past penny
finds by month or year. For example, a page that says “Penny List Archive: [November 2025]
[October 2025] [September 2025] …” with each link leading to the Penny List filtered for that timeframe

21 22 . You can manually update this list as each month ends or generate it programmatically. This
serves two purposes: 

1. Users can quickly jump to historical data (e.g. “What was on the list last December?”) without
fiddling with filters. 

2. Search engines get crawlable links for older content, improving SEO. (Currently, an older
item might be hidden unless “All” is selected, which a crawler may not do. An archive page
ensures even older items are one click away in plain HTML.) 

• State-Specific Pages (long-term SEO idea): If you want to get ambitious with SEO, consider creating
static pages for popular state queries, e.g. /penny-list/GA  that shows Georgia finds. This could
attract search queries like “Home Depot penny deals Georgia”. However, implementing this requires
some routing logic and duplication of the Penny List view per state, which can be complex and
possibly overkill in Month 2. You can defer this unless you see a significant number of users asking
for state-specific links. It’s a nice-to-have that can wait until you have more bandwidth. 

• Content Marketing: If you have time and interest, publish a small blog post or two on penny
shopping tips or a story of a great find. This isn’t essential, but any original content can boost SEO
and give users more reason to visit the site. Keep it lightweight – even a quarterly update or a
highlights reel of best finds can engage users. (Make sure to share any new content on social channels
for double exposure.)

• Monitor Growth & Community Health: Continue the practices from Week 4 into this month: keep
an eye on submissions and site metrics. By now you might have a modest but steady flow. Engage
with users who are contributing often – a quick thank-you email or shout-out (if you recognize a
submitter via Facebook) can go a long way to retain them. This builds community loyalty at no cost. 

• Moderation stance: Remains the same – manual, low-touch. You’re likely still spending only a few
minutes here and there to remove any bad data (which hopefully is near zero incidents). If
community participation grew, maybe one or two trusted members could be given access to the
Google Sheet to help curate (as “mods”), but only do this if you actually have volunteers and it would
save you significant time. At ~5 hrs/week total, you’re probably fine handling it solo for now.

• Site performance: With more usage, just ensure the site stays fast. Check for any spike in errors or
slow load times in your analytics. If you embedded a form or added scripts (like GA), verify they
aren’t slowing things. Thus far, using mostly client-side and external tools (Google Forms, Sheets)
offloads a lot of work to those platforms, keeping your site backend simple – which is good for
scaling with minimal effort.

Month 2 Summary: The focus is on removing friction for users (to submit and to find info) and laying
groundwork  for  discoverability.  All  enhancements  (archive  page,  etc.)  are  low-
maintenance. You’re still well within the 5-hour weekly budget. By the end of month 2, you should see a
larger community presence on the site, more new reports coming in, and hopefully some search engine
traffic starting to trickle in as content ages and indexes.





Month 3: Expand Reach & Enhance Trust Signals (Lightly)
Milestone: Three  months  in,  aim  to  broaden  Penny  Central’s  reach and  consider  subtle  trust
enhancements that don’t burden users. At this stage, focus on scaling up the user base and making the
data even more compelling, while deferring any heavyweight features.

• Broader Outreach & SEO Boost: If your user base is still primarily the initial community (e.g. your
FB group), month 3 is a good time to widen the net a bit more.

• SEO Review: Check your search rankings for relevant terms (“Home Depot penny list”, “penny deals
[Your Region]”). If you’re not on the first page, think about what could improve that. Often, it’s
content and backlinks. You might decide to do a guest post on a deals forum or collaborate with a
penny-shopping YouTuber/blogger to mention Penny Central. Even a few inbound links or mentions
can boost your SEO. This is a marketing task, not coding, and should be done only if you enjoy it – it’s
optional but can accelerate growth. 

• State/Store Pages (if not done): Revisit the idea of state-specific or store-specific pages. By now you
have data on which states see the most finds. If you notice, say, California and Texas are hot,
creating pages or at least adding content sections for those (“Recent penny finds in California: …”)
could target popular interest areas. This can be as simple as an H2 on your Penny List page that
appears when a state filter is active (with some SEO-friendly text about penny deals in that state).
Again, it’s added complexity, so weigh the benefit vs. maintenance. A simpler proxy: publish a
periodic “Top 5 states with penny deals this month” on your blog or social – fun content that also
signals the geographic spread.

• Local Communities: If not already, consider sharing the site in other related communities (local deal
groups, Reddit r/DiscountShopping, etc.). Be mindful of not spamming; present it as a useful tool.
The goal is to attract users who find value and might contribute, not just a one-time spike of traffic.

• Enhance Trust Through Transparency: While we avoid heavy-handed trust systems, you can still 
boost user confidence in the data with a few light-touch ideas:

• Crowd-Verified Indicators: You already label items as “Rare / Common / Very Common” based on
number of reports – this is excellent and should remain prominent as it inherently tells users how
verified something is by the crowd 23 24 . Consider if you want to adjust the thresholds or wording
over time (for instance, if you now have items with 10+ reports regularly, maybe introduce an even
higher tier or simply let “Very Common” cover it). This doesn’t require new development, just a
possible config change. 
 

• User Feedback Loop: If not already done, make sure it’s easy for users to report inaccuracies (as
noted in Week 3). By now, if any item turned out to not actually be a penny (e.g. a false alarm), you
likely heard about it via Facebook or feedback. When that happens, promptly remove or flag it with a
note. This responsive moderation (even if manual) will be noticed and appreciated by the
community, increasing their trust in the list.

• Success Stories: If you have a way for users to share that they scored a penny deal thanks to the list,
highlight that! For example, if someone comments “I used Penny Central and found X item, thanks!”,
ask their permission to quote them (anonymously if needed) on your site or social. A small




testimonials section or tweet screenshot can act as social proof that the list works. This isn’t coding
work; just a content idea that can reinforce trust.

• Continued Low-Touch Maintenance: Your day-to-day (or week-to-week) routine should still be
manageable:

• Checking the sheet, removing bad entries if any, interacting with community posts – likely still just a
few hours a week. If it’s growing beyond that, it’s a good problem (means lots of activity) and you
might start thinking about automation or help, but at 3 months, the load should be comfortable.

• Make note of any recurring pain points. For instance, if you find you’re frequently editing the sheet
to fix formatting or merging duplicates, think about a code solution (like a script to auto-clean or
detect duplicates). Tiny automations can save you time. You could add these as backlog items to
tackle in a slow week. Use your AI coder to write such scripts when needed.

• Keep an eye on technical metrics: if your site is getting much heavier traffic now, ensure your free
tier hosting isn’t hitting limits. Vercel’s hobby tier and Google Sheets can handle quite a bit, but if you
approach limits (bandwidth or API calls), plan an upgrade. Typically, static content scaling is graceful,
so you’ll likely be fine through month 3.

Month 3 Summary: Expand your  audience and  reinforce credibility.  By now, you have a stable base;
small tweaks like emphasizing community-verified labels and sharing success stories will further build trust.
Everything suggested remains simple to execute and maintain. You’re essentially amplifying what’s working
(community contributions, daily updates) and communicating value to a broader crowd, all within a light
workload.

Month 4: Scale & Optimize (Prepare for More Traffic)
Milestone: In month 4, focus on scaling gracefully. If Penny Central is growing, ensure the technology and
workflow can handle increased load without significantly more manual work. We also consider monetization
edges in case you want to offset costs, but with a light touch.

• Performance and Infrastructure: Evaluate if it’s time to beef up any infrastructure given user
growth.

• Google Sheets Limits: A single Google Sheet can handle thousands of rows, but if you’re
approaching, say, 10k+ submissions or noticing slow fetch times, it might be time to consider a
database. Look at fetch latency – if pulling the CSV is slowing down page loads, an intermediary
caching layer or moving to a small database (e.g. Airtable, Supabase) could help 25 26 . Only do
this if necessary. There’s a lot of headroom on Google’s free tier. A possible intermediate step: use
the Google Sheets API to fetch just new entries (though that adds complexity). 

• Hosting Plan: Check Vercel’s analytics for bandwidth usage. If you’re still within the free/hobby
limits, great. If you see yourself hitting limits due to heavy traffic or if build times are getting long,
upgrading to a paid plan (~$20/mo) might be warranted. This is a quick configuration change,
not a coding task. 

• Optimize Build/Fetch: If the site rebuild (ISR or getServerSideProps) is becoming slow with lots of
data, consider optimizations. For instance, if “All time” view now loads hundreds of items and that
slows initial render, you could implement basic pagination (split the list into pages of 100 items).
Static generation for each page can keep it fast. But again, don’t over-engineer – do this only if you
observe real slowdowns or timeouts. A site with a few hundred entries should still load quickly as a
static bundle.





• Image Hosting Check: By month 4, you might decide to start showing user-uploaded photos on the
site (instead of just the official product images). If you do, consider moving those images to a proper
host. Right now, photos are likely on your Google Drive (from the form) – serving those could be slow
or permission-limited. A free Cloudinary account or an S3 bucket with CloudFront CDN can store
these images and provide fast loads 27 . This requires writing a script to periodically upload new
images and store their URLs, or a direct integration when form submits (via Zapier or webhooks). It’s
added work, so weigh it: many users might be fine with not seeing the actual receipt photo as long
as the product image is there. You can also continue hiding user photos and just using them behind
the scenes for verification. Action: Decide if showing user proof images adds significant value. If yes,
plan a simple image hosting workflow; if no, skip it and keep things simple.

• Light Monetization Experiments (Optional): You’ve likely spent a bit on domains or tools; if traffic
is decent by month 4, you might explore small ways to earn or cover costs, without hurting UX. 

• Affiliate Links: If not already, ensure any outbound product links (e.g. if you link to Home Depot site
or Amazon for alternatives) have affiliate tracking. You may already have a setup (the code snippet
references a befrugal  link which might be an affiliate redirect). Double-check those are working
and consider adding unobtrusive affiliate links where appropriate. Example: If an item is penny (in-
store only) and there’s a similar item online, a note like “Can’t find it? [Buy similar online]” with an
affiliate link could generate a few bucks. Keep it subtle; user trust comes first. 

• Ads (Cautiously): If your page views are high, Google AdSense or a simple ad banner might
generate revenue. But ads can slow down the site and annoy users. A possible approach: start with a
single ad slot on a less intrusive page (maybe the Guide or a sidebar) and see how it performs. Given
your niche, ad revenue may be low, so weigh the clutter it adds. This is purely optional and only if
you feel it’s needed to sustain costs. It can always be removed if it doesn’t pay off or harms the
experience.

• Premium Features (Planning): It’s likely too early to launch any premium subscription, but you can
start speculating what a future “Pro” tier might look like (alerts, real-time feed, etc.) 28 29 . You had
ideas like a paid real-time list or instant alerts vs. 24h delayed free list. At month 4, just gauge if
there’s demand: are users asking for more? If you have an email list or feedback form, you could
even poll your users casually: “Would you be interested in SMS or email alerts for new penny finds?”
If there’s enthusiasm and the user base is large enough, you might schedule building such a feature
in month 6 or beyond. If not, keep it on the back burner. Remember: Do not add login/account
complexity until it’s absolutely necessary; it will significantly raise your maintenance and support
load.

• Community Building: With a few months of activity, consider doing something fun to strengthen
the community:

• Perhaps run a giveaway or contest for contributors (e.g. a $50 gift card raffle among everyone who
submitted a find in the last month) 30 . This can spur submissions without any complex system – you
can just manually pick from the sheet entries. It’s a light incentive that might cost a bit of money but
can energize participation. Only do this if submission rates are dipping or you want a boost. 

• Or spotlight “Contributor of the Month” on the site (with permission) to recognize someone feeding
great info. A little appreciation can go a long way and costs nothing. 

Month 4 Summary: This phase is about reinforcing the infrastructure as your project grows, and thinking
ahead about sustainability (both technical and financial). You’re still keeping things as simple as possible:
upgrading existing services rather than overhauling, adding a dash of monetization carefully, and nurturing
the community vibe. All of these can be done incrementally and toggled on/off as needed – nothing locks
you into a heavy commitment.





Month 5: Refine Features & Evaluate Requests
Milestone: By month 5,  you might have accumulated user feedback and feature requests.  This month,
focus on  refining existing features and carefully  considering any new ones.  Ensure everything added
aligns with keeping the project low-maintenance.

• Polish Existing Features: Take stock of the features introduced in earlier months and see if any
need refinement:

• Filtering & Sorting: Are users making suggestions about filtering (e.g., filter by product category or
sort by popularity)? If there’s a common ask and it’s simple to do, consider it. For instance, a “Sort by
Most Reports” option could be useful (it’s basically your trending logic applied to the whole list).
Implementing that might be as easy as adding a client-side sort button that toggles between date
(newest) and report count. It doesn’t add backend load and can be done with some JavaScript. If you
implement, watch that it doesn’t confuse users (make sure there’s a clear indication of sort order). 

• Mobile/User Experience: With more users, you might catch smaller UX issues to fix. Maybe the
archive page needs a better layout, or the form embed could use some styling tweaks to match your
site theme. Tackle these little improvements now. None should be too time-consuming. 

• Accessibility & Design Pass: Ensure the site still meets your accessibility and design goals (contrast,
mobile-friendliness, etc.). Over months of changes, sometimes small regressions happen (like a text
color that is hard to read in dark mode after you changed a background). Do a quick audit and use
your existing checklist (if any) to make sure everything is up to spec. This avoids piling up “design
debt.”

• Assess New Feature Requests: By now, users might be asking for features. Common ones could be
comments on items, user accounts, notification systems, etc. It’s tempting to jump into building
these, but weigh each against your maintenance bandwidth:

• Comments/Discussion: Having a comment thread per item would definitely increase engagement,
but it requires user accounts or a third-party system, plus moderation. That’s heavy. You can
achieve some of the benefit (users discussing finds) by simply encouraging them to do so on your
existing Facebook group or a Reddit thread you host. This keeps it off your site (zero tech work for
you) but still lets the community discuss. You can link to those discussions if appropriate. So likely 
defer on-site comments unless the community outgrows external channels. 

• Upvote/Downvote or Confirmation Buttons: This is another idea for trust – let users click to say “I
found this too” or “Not available”. However, implementing this means tracking users or at least
cookies to prevent spam, and potentially could be gamed. Given that your report count and state
coverage already serve this purpose, you can skip explicit voting for now 18 . Perhaps in the future if
the volume is enormous you could have a simple thumbs-up, but it’s not needed yet and would add
complexity (and some moderation overhead if people misuse it). 

• Email Alerts / Newsletter: If you haven’t done any email capture yet, reconsider it this month. An
easy way is to start a free Mailchimp list or similar, and let people subscribe for updates. It could be a
monthly summary of new penny items or an immediate alert for new finds. Since real-time alerts are
a premium idea, maybe a weekly summary email is a good start that doesn’t cannibalize the site
usage. This is a bit of extra work to set up (and to create content for regularly), so only do it if you
have a substantial audience that would appreciate it. Otherwise, keep focusing on in-site experience.
(Remember: an automated daily or weekly email could be generated from the data – an AI could
even help draft it – but you’d have to orchestrate that. It might be something to try if you enjoy it and
have time.)



• Monetization Check: Evaluate how any monetization efforts from month 4 are doing. If you put ads
and they’re not worth the hassle, remove them. If affiliate links are getting clicks, see if you can
optimize placement a bit. The key is to keep the site’s credibility; don’t let money-making schemes
degrade the user experience. By month 5, you can decide to double down on something that works
or scrap what doesn’t, with minimal impact.

• Plan for Long-Term Maintenance: Begin drafting how you’ll handle the site post-6 months (when
this intensive build/launch phase passes). Since you only can spend ~5 hours a week:

• Automate wherever possible. For example, if you find yourself doing a repetitive task weekly (like
updating an archive page manually each month), write a quick script or use an AI to help automate
it. This might be the time to implement that cron job or script to, say, copy new sheet rows into a
database or update a JSON backup. Such automation ensures the site can run with minimal
oversight. 

• Documentation: Document any quirky processes (perhaps in a simple README). If you do bring on a
volunteer mod or an assistant, it helps to have notes. Even for future-you, having a cheatsheet of
“How to import data” or “How to deploy” is useful if you step away for a while and return. 

• Community self-sufficiency: If the community is vibrant, you might find they answer each other’s
questions and self-moderate bad info. Cultivate this by being present but not overbearing. By now
you might have a couple of “power users” – consider giving them moderation powers in the
Facebook group or bounce ideas off them. They can help carry the load.

Month 5 Summary: This month is about fine-tuning and evaluating. You’ve built a lot of functionality in a
short time; ensure it’s all refined and truly serving its purpose. Listen to your users, but also stick to your
project  principles  (speed,  simplicity,  low maintenance).  Many feature requests  can be satisfied through
creative, non-development solutions (like leveraging existing platforms for discussion or alerts). By keeping
the scope in check, you ensure Penny Central remains sustainable and enjoyable to run.

Month 6: Review, Celebrate, and Strategize Next Steps
Milestone: Reach six months of Penny Central being live and community-driven! This is a point to review
success metrics against your goals and make a decision on the project’s future direction with clarity on
trust, growth, and workload.

• Comprehensive Metric Review: Dive into all the data:
• Traffic & Engagement: How has the site traffic grown over six months? Look at monthly active

users, daily visits, average session duration. Are people coming back frequently (indicative of habit
loops working)? Identify any traffic spikes and their sources (perhaps a particular social post or an
SEO event). 

• Submission Volume: Total number of community submissions, and the trend (steady increase,
plateau, seasonal?). Which channels brought in most contributors? For example, did Facebook drives
most, or did SEO start bringing random shoppers? This helps decide where to focus outreach in the
future. 

• Data Quality: How many entries had to be removed or moderated? If it’s near zero, that validates
the lightweight approach. If there were issues, what were they? (e.g., one user kept submitting junk).
Use this to decide if stronger moderation tools are needed soon or if current measures suffice. 

• Community Growth: Check your social following or mailing list (if you have one). Is the community
around Penny Central growing in tandem with site usage? A healthy community means more
organic content (submissions, shares) which lessens your burden.



• Evaluate Maintenance Burden: Reflect on your time spent. Have you been able to keep it around 5
hours a week on average? If it’s creeping up, where is the time going? 

• If moderation/review is taking more time, consider again enabling more automation or help (maybe
it’s time to turn on that Approved  checkbox and recruit a helper if you haven’t). 

• If content creation (posts, emails) is taking time, consider scaling it back or using AI to assist (e.g.,
have ChatGPT draft your weekly Facebook post from the latest finds list). 

• Ideally, by month 6 the system largely runs itself with you just overseeing. If that’s not the case,
identify the pain points and address them with either tools or by cutting non-essential tasks.

• Trust & User Satisfaction: Maybe run a quick user survey or just solicit feedback informally: “What
do you love about Penny Central? What would you improve?” Given the niche, you might directly ask a
few engaged users. Look for signals: do people trust the list? Do they rely on it weekly? Any
anecdotes of it saving them time or money? Success stories mean you’ve achieved the core goal of
being a useful hub. Any common critique (e.g. “wish it had feature X”) that you’ve consistently
decided against (due to complexity) – explain to users why, or consider if there’s a compromise
solution.

• Roadmap Decisions: Decide on the direction for the next 6 months (and beyond) based on
everything above:

• If growth is strong and you’re comfortable, you might double down: maybe invest a bit more time or
money to accelerate (perhaps build that mobile app or add the big features like accounts – only if
truly justified). 

• If growth is modest but steady, you might continue the slow-and-steady approach: keep the site
updated, gradually improve SEO and content, and let it build organically. This might mean minimal
new features, just regular maintenance and small tweaks. That’s perfectly fine, especially given your
limited time – the project can remain a “side project” that still serves its community well. 

• If the concept hasn’t gained traction (e.g. users didn’t adopt it and still rely on other channels),
analyze why. It might be a discovery issue (not enough people know about it) – in which case,
consider a marketing push – or a product fit issue (maybe people prefer the social aspect of
Facebook rather than a separate site). If it’s the latter, you might pivot strategy: perhaps integrating
more social features or simply using Penny Central as a companion to the Facebook group rather
than a replacement. 

• Monetization Outlook: By now you can gauge if revenue is something to pursue. If you’re getting
decent affiliate or ad income (covering costs or even profit), you could reinvest that (better hosting,
small paid ads for the site, etc.). If not, decide if you’re okay with that or want to try something new
(like a Patreon or donation model – some communities will gladly chip in to keep a useful service
running). Again, keep it user-friendly; many would prefer a free resource with maybe a gentle “Buy
me a coffee” tip jar than a paywalled service.

• Celebrate and Communicate: Don’t forget to celebrate the milestone! Share a “6 months of Penny
Central” update with the community. Thank them for making it a success (mention how many penny
finds were shared, etc.). People love to see the impact of their contributions. This not only rewards
existing users but can attract new ones (as it showcases an active, successful platform). It’s also
personally rewarding for you as the creator and keeps momentum and positivity going.

Month 6 Summary: This month is about reflection and adjustment. By its end, you should have a clear
picture of Penny Central’s trajectory and a refined plan for the future. Whether that’s scaling up with new
features, maintaining the status quo, or making a pivot, you’ll base it on real data and experience from the
past six months. The key outcome is that the project remains  grounded, sustainable, and aligned with
your initial goals – providing quick, reliable penny deal info with minimal burnout or overhead.



Technical Debt & UX Snags – Brief Checkpoints
(Throughout the execution, keep these in mind to avoid long-term issues. These don’t all need action now, but
should be acknowledged and addressed when practical.)

• Image Hosting/Display: Currently, users provide photo proof, but those images aren’t shown on the
site (or if they are, they’re via Google Drive links which can be slow). This is acceptable now (the
product images suffice), but eventually you may want to display user photos. When that time comes,
plan for a proper hosting solution (Cloudinary, etc.) to serve images quickly and avoid broken
permissions 27 . Until then, continue to collect photos mainly as a behind-the-scenes verification
method to keep submissions honest.

• Google Sheets Limits & Backup: Relying on a Google Sheet is wonderfully lightweight, but it’s wise
to occasionally back up the data (e.g. export to CSV monthly). Sheets have version history, but a local
backup script (perhaps run via AI) can’t hurt. Also, if you foresee hitting row limits (around 100k rows)
or performance issues, start planning a migration to a database before it becomes urgent. This
project can likely run on Sheets for quite a long time, so this is a low-priority note.

• Codebase Maintenance: With multiple quick changes being made, ensure you’re using source
control (Git) properly. Merge and test in a staging environment if possible before going to
production. Your .ai/  planning docs and test checklists are great – keep them updated with any
new constraints. This discipline will prevent regressions as you continuously improve the site.

• Accessibility (A11y): Always confirm new UI changes (like the compact layout or new filter options)
maintain accessibility. Use semantic HTML, alt tags for any new images, and test keyboard
navigation after changes. It’s easier to fix these as you go than retroactively.

• Responsive Design Snags: Monitor if any layout shifts or overflow issues pop up on certain devices
(e.g., long item names might overflow a card on small screens). Tackle these with quick CSS fixes
when noticed. Given your mobile-first approach from the start, you should be in good shape. Just
don’t let small visual issues linger; they can accumulate and hurt UX.

• No Over-Engineering: This is more of a principle than debt – but continue to resist adding
complexity “because it’s cool.” Every feature should earn its keep (especially anything that would
need ongoing moderation or could confuse users). For example, before implementing a fancy live
chat or a complex points system for contributors, ask if it truly solves a current problem or if a
simpler solution exists. This will keep your project lean and enjoyable to manage.

• Documentation & Bus Factor: As the sole (or primary) maintainer, make sure the critical parts of
the system are documented for your future self. If you step away for a month, you’ll want to easily
recall how data flows from the form to the site, or how to deploy updates. A few markdown notes
about “How Penny Central works behind the scenes” can save you time later. It also helps onboard
any collaborator quickly if you ever get assistance.

By  minding  these  technical  and  UX  considerations  in  parallel  with  the  timeline,  you’ll  prevent  the
accumulation of messy issues and keep the project agile. Each item is relatively small, but together they
ensure Penny Central remains fast, reliable, and user-friendly as it grows.

With this revised plan, Penny Central’s path forward is clear and actionable. You are focusing on high-impact
improvements (growth, engagement, trust via community verification) while deferring or simplifying anything that
doesn’t yet warrant the complexity. Each week and month has concrete steps and uses tools at your disposal –
from AI coding assistants to free cloud services – to keep the workload light. By sticking to this approach, you’ll
steadily  enhance  the  platform  and  community  without  burning  out  or  getting  bogged  down  in  premature
problems. Happy penny hunting and site building!
