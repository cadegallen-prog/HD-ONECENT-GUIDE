# GITHUB COPILOT CHAT INSTRUCTIONS

If you are GitHub Copilot Chat working in this repo, follow these rules.

---

## Quick Start

1. **Behavior rules:** Read `AGENTS.md` — the master source of truth for constraints, design system, and documentation structure.
2. **Skills & stack:** Skim `SKILLS.md` — compact reference for tools, domains, and MCP usage patterns.
3. **Current state:** Check `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` for priorities and status.

## Copilot-Specific Notes

1. **Credits matter.** Deliver substantial progress per response. Prefer dense answers over many exchanges.

2. **Small, focused tasks.** The user typically wants one feature, one fix, or one integration. No refactor adventures.

3. **Minimal edits.** Keep changes as small and local as possible. Avoid reorganizing folders or renaming files.

4. **Complete code.** The user cannot "fill in gaps." Provide working examples, not stubs.

5. **After changes:**
   - Post a short summary (files changed, what changed).
   - Update `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` or `CHANGELOG.md` if meaningful work was done.

6. **When unsure:** Default to minimal change with comments explaining how to extend later.
