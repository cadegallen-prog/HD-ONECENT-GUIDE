This file gives a high level view of what this project does, what is done, and what is planned.

Agents: keep this file short and useful. Update it when you actually finish or significantly change something.

## 1. Product Context

**What:** PennyCentral.com - a utility/reference guide for finding Home Depot clearance items marked to $0.01.

**Who:** Members of the "Home Depot One Cent Items" Facebook community (37,000+ members). Savvy shoppers who want actionable intel, not hype.

**Core value:** Education on how clearance works, tools to find stores and plan trips, and realistic guidance on whether items are worth buying.

**Non-goals:**

- Not a marketplace or forum
- Not gamified (no XP, badges, levels)
- Not a blog with constant content churn
- Not a data scraping or inventory tracking service

**Success looks like:**

- Users find the info they need quickly
- Tools (Store Finder, Trip Tracker) work reliably
- Site stays simple and fast
- Minimal maintenance burden
